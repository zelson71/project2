Smells explosive and fantastic, with white chocolate, nougat, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, anisette and Kahl\u00faa, and turns classically rich in the mouth. The flavors are enormous, and very sweet, but what's most impressive is the texture\u2014sheer velvet with perfect, bright acid. \u2014S.H.","1":"A wave of ripe, juicy black cherry reaches the nose before hints of cinnamon follow, colored by a lovely floral perfume. The palate is pliable with a fruity, friendly flow, yet this shows depth and charm. The mouthfeel is soft and sinuous, the tannins are fine and have a gauze-like quality that might tip over into velvet any moment. If you need a wine to seduce someone, this might just be it. Simply lovely now but will get much better with age. Drink 2020\u20132035.","2":"Salt, pepper and lemon notes own the nose offer the promise of savoriness. The palate then wheels out all the salty concentration in full force. This tingles like lemon zest and has the texture of citrus pith. Concentration and savoriness are written all over it. This is compact, deeply savory and totally lip-smacking.","3":"Clouds of aromatic flower play along with zesty orange flavors. Grapefruit provides spice and drive. The palate shows that counterpoint of ripeness and tartness that makes this so very moreish. This is juicy and powerful, yet precise and toned despite all its generosity. This is a light, tightrope walk between two thrilling worlds. It's full of life and joy with an endless finish.","4":"This wine must have spent very little time in bottle; it still smells of the leesy, fermentative richness of the cellar. But never fear: this newborn is loaded with lemon concentration and uncompromising briskness. Electric freshness is its central purpose, and it will provide sophisticated refreshment for years to come. Drink 2020\u20132030 at least.","5":"Apple and passion fruit are the aromatic top notes, hovering above a nose of honey and musk. Notes of honey, caramel and maple syrup seem to unite on the palate, guided and framed by the sharpest, most luminous acidity. Extremes are at work here, revealing both utter sweetness and utter acidity. Dazzling all of the senses, this wine leaves a rich aftertaste.","6":"Notions of honeyed, candied richness reach the nose, spiked with a vivid dollop of citrus sharpness. This sweet Sp\u00e4tlese promises thrill and delivers it with notions of apple jelly, tart passion fruit and tropical hints of candied pineapple. Sharp acid counters the richness in the most delicious fashion. Follow the suggestions on the label and pair this with Szechuan pepper and red hot chilies to achieve Asian magic. Fruity, tropical desserts will also be elevated by this sexy and sharp little number.","7":"Lime blossom tea, candied apple and an alluring edge of smoke lend extra dimensions to the nose. The palate brings forth the full force of luscious, concentrated botrytis with its generous sweetness and bundled force of balancing, spicy freshness. This possesses wonderful balance and leaves lasting, lemon-flavored sweetness.","8":"Immense concentration rises headily from the glass, projecting musk, lemon and crushed banana peel. The twin forces of sweetness and acidity then attack the palate with undiminished vigor, unraveling their power play across the tongue with notions of Mirabelle plum jam and candied lemon. Precision and vigor imbue this with longevity. Drink until 2040, at least.","9":"The fragrant, absolute varietal purity of green pear and grapefruit zest attains an additional thrill of orange-peel lift. The palate is sweet but not overwhelmingly so: all is balanced and countered by freshness and a light touch. This richness dances on ballerina's tiptoe. That aromatic streak of citrus freshness unites grapefruit and greengage, honey and lime. This is utter purity of fruit in an Eiswein of immense, irresistible charm with moreish, lemon-pure length.","10":"Massively fruity and oaky, this is an atom bomb of a Chardonnay. You either love this style or you hate it. The pineapple tart, apricot, pear, peach, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, buttered toast, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice flavors go on and on. Beyond the utter richness is firm acidity and a bracing minerality. Defines California-style decadence, but drink now, as the wine will quickly go downhill.","11":"Dark and racy, with a Northern Rh\u00f4ne-style aroma of black pepper, cedar and black currants, but there's nothing Rh\u00f4ne-like about the flavor. It's distinctly California, with soft, sweetly ripe tannins bursting with blackberry jam, black currants, anise, vanilla and sweet oak flavors. The wine is fully dry. Absolutely first-rate Syrah.","12":"A gorgeous aroma like roses and blackberries meets richly concentrated and ripe black-fruit flavors in this full-bodied, luxuriously textured wine. While extremely ripe and bold, the wine is also smooth and voluptuous, balanced out by silky tannins that keep the mouthfeel lively and fresh sip after sip.","13":"Here's a picture-perfect Cabernet with a nose so true and dense that you can barely get inside, but once you do everything is there. Huge, dynamic fruit plays off fine wood notes. Mighty tannins build up and prolong the flavorful, intense finish. A very big, very black wine that is also very, very good. From the family that owns Sutter Home.","14":"Bright freshness rules the day in this delicious vintage of Elias Fernandez's side project with Doug Shafer. Green apple, Meyer lemon and lime flavors provide pleasure, with a tense vibrancy and focused acidity filling the palate.","15":"Extraordinarily sweet and concentrated, coating the mouth with sugar and honey and the distinctive apricot flavor of botrytis. The underlying fruit flavors veer toward mangoes and papaya, although high acidity makes for a citrusy undercurrent. It's not just rich, it's elegant.","16":"A touch of Viognier ignites a pretty, seductive nose with spicy fruit and cocoa, as well as raspberry and mineral notes. As it unfolds the wine displays enormous complexity, with tart currant and cranberry fruit leading into a tight, sharp, brightly etched finish. It's one of the rare Zins that can stake a legitimate claim to tasting of terroir.","17":"There's a good chance you haven't heard of this wine, but drop what you're doing and try to track some down. Its brilliantly pure nose literally explodes from the glass and then gets better with time. Textured but not overdone, this is perfectly ripe Napa fruit from Rutherford and Howell Mountain brought to market with a masterful touch. Sublime vanilla and chocolaty notes in the bouquet, on the palate, and on the finish.","18":"Heitz has made this stellar ros\u00e9 from the rare Grignolino grape since 1961. Ruby grapefruit-red, it's sultry with strawberry, watermelon, orange zest and salty spice flavor, highlighted with vibrant floral aromas.","19":"This dessert wine has pushed itself to the front of the line of California sweeties, and the '04 is a great bottling. It's enormously sweet in late-harvest character, with apricot liqueur, pineapple tart and vanilla cream flavors that are brightened and boosted with cleansing acidity. So addictively delicious you just can't help yourself.","20":"With 21% residual sugar, this is an enormously sweet wine, one of the most honeyed of the vintage. A little sugar goes a long way, of course, but this wine also charms with rich, powerful apricot, peach and vanilla custard flavors, perfectly balanced with crisp acidity. With consistently high scores over the years, Tears of Dew has taken a place in the front ranks of California dessert white wines.","21":"Amazingly rich and ripe, defining the Bien Nacido cool-climate style. The grapes hung for a long time in this excellent vintage, getting ripe and balanced, and the wine offers dazzling opulence, while preserving vital acidity. Showcases dessert pastry flavors of pineapples, mangoes, buttered toast, buttercream, meringue and honeysuckle, accented with dusty spices. Simply beautiful from first sniff to the last swallow.","22":"Picked at an unbelievable 38 degrees of brix, with residual sugar of 12.5%, this is a very, very sweet wine. It has an unctuous, honeyed texture, but super-high acidity breaks it up. Flavorwise, it's botrytis-infected apricot-infused cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Wow.","23":"Here's a stunning Merlot, not from the North Coast but a warmish region of Santa Barbara. Shows currant and dark-chocolate aromas with soy, anise and leather. Drinks soft and rich, really high quality, such depth and intensity. A great Merlot, but only 170 cases to go around.","24":"This is a complex and layered Mourv\u00e8dre. Fragrances of rose petals, cinnamon, mace, blackberry and black cherry prove almost overpowering, yet delicious. The palate puts black plum and black cherry together with star anise, clove and an array of baking spice. There's a lot going on, but it's harmonious and balanced.","25":"About as rich and flamboyant as California Chardonnay gets, a wine that blows you away with sheer pyrotechnic wizardry. Massive in grilled pineapples, mangoes, Key lime pie, vanilla honey, cr\u00e8me caramel and dusty spices, accented with perfect acidity.","26":"Light in color, alcohol and texture, this dynamic wine has a fresh pepper flavor, and is gorgeous all around, like drinking fresh rose petals. This could be enjoyed all day long, every day, but with only 51 cases produced, get it now or you'll miss out on it.","27":"Inky dark and saturated, with scads of glycerine, a serious young wine. Erupts with cascades of white pepper, violets, cassis, plum pudding, rum, molasses, sweet kid leather, root beer and more. In the mouth, the primary fruit is black cherries and kirsch, while the new oak and glycerine makes for a rich, honeyed, almost unguent mouthfeel. Decant if you open it now; should gain additional complexities in the next eight years. Editors' Choice.","28":"Massive, opulent, oozing in pineapple cr\u00e9me brul\u00e9e, honey, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors. Totally decadent, and fortunately set off with brisk, citrusy acidity. Calling all lobsters, and don't forget the drawn butter. Sheer hedonism in a glass, at a fantastic price.","29":"Don't drink this beauty too cold with your lobster, crab or scallops. It has the weight of a noble wine, with minerality and creaminess giving shape and texture to the leesy, yeasty flavors of pineapples, Key lime pie and ripe pear pur\u00e9e. Aged in 40% new French oak, California Chardonnay hardly gets any better than this.","30":"This stainless steel-fermented wine is dry, fresh and delightful. Flavors of apricot and white peach tease the palate and are joined by grapefruit, wet stone and lime zest. The vibrant acidity lingers alongside tones of ginger and oyster shell on the finish.","31":"A brilliant, completely satisfying Viognier that shows its sunny California terroir in the ripe lemon, peach and mango flavors. It finishes dry, with a steely minerality, like stones and cold metal. Just gorgeous, one of the finest California Viogniers ever.","32":"This is De Loach's finest Zinfandel of their five new releases. In fact, it's their best Zinfandel ever, and one that defines Sonoma County cool-climate Zinfandel. It's brilliant in balance and structure, with beautifully sculpted tannins and fine acidity, and just the right touch of oak. Within that package are savory flavors of wild blackberries, picked at their peak under the summer sun. So easy to drink, yet so complex.","33":"A brilliant Chardonnay. Almost nothing quite like it out there. Great, zesty acidity makes the mouth water, and oak is strongly there but perfectly vindicated by the power of the underlying flavors. They suggest ripe pineapples and tropical fruits, peaches, honeysuckle and a firm, stony minerality that has to come from the soil. For all the richness, the wine is terrifically dry.","34":"This marks another stunning vintage for this blend of 55% S\u00e9millon, 25% Muscadelle, 10% Palomino and 10% Colombard, made by Zin master Mike Officer. Pungent in pear and pineapple, it has cutting-edge minerality, a taste of slate, and remains at turns creamy and crisp on the palate. This wine is unusual in all the right ways yet triumphantly delicious.","35":"This excellent wine from a steep terraced vineyard offers beautiful aromas of lavender and violet that segue to a palate replete with black fruit, black pepper and anise tones. Each flavor seems especially well defined and they layer together harmoniously on a velvety texture that provides good support for all that concentration. Best after 2020.","36":"Using fruit sourced from a single vineyard with great sun exposure, this wine takes its name from the stony soil. It provides great balance between the dense black fruit and the taut, minerally texture, expressing the essence of Malbec in Cahors. It certainly needs several years of aging.","37":"Pure Petit Manseng harvested in November has given the essence of Juran\u00e7on. Superbly ripe, botrytised fruit is perfectly balanced with layers of freshness, apricot juice and a crisp, nervy texture. It's a young wine and really should not be drunk before 2018.","38":"The home vineyard of Madiran's star, Alain Brumont, has yielded a superb wine that is full of dark tannins and with a considerable ability to age. It is balanced, concentrated and touched by spice and toastiness from the wood aging. In tandem with that are generous fruits within a dense structure that is just beginning to smooth out. Drink from 2018\u20132038.","39":"There is a tough, tannic core to this otherwise ripe and fruity wine. All to the good, as this will allow the bold, ripe wine to age well. Black-currant fruits are already showing their hand and will intensify, bringing in richness and a dense texture. Drink this wine from 2025.","40":"A gentle touch of crushed thyme precedes very pure lemon hints on the nose. The palate fills out with far more luscious citrus, suggesting tart but juicy tangerine and more vivid lemon. The fine and slender structure holds all of this zesty, refreshing fruit with grace and lightness\u2014a wonderfully vivid, bright and utterly citrus-driven wine with a long dry refreshing finish.","41":"Just tender notes of freshly cut lemon peel reach the nose. A little more air reveals a touch of heady lime. The clean-cut palate sticks to this taut lime and lemon scheme with incisive freshness and tingling zingy tanginess. Cool freshness seems like a vein at the core of this taut, restrained and fresh wine. The finish is dry and clean. This will need time to unfurl its full force of citrus. Drink 2020\u20132038.","42":"The faintest hint of elderflower touches upon the subtle lemon-peel notes on the nose before riper hints of orange appear. The palate comes with real impact but on a very filigree-fine structure that uses lemon zest both as a structural base for freshness and as a swirling aromatic highlight. This is lovely, sinuous, long and concentrated, slender but impactful and rather elegant. Lovely. Drink now through 2040.","43":"This Pinot Gris shows sweetness, some honey but also a fine mineral structure, which promises aging at least for 10 years. Imported by Maisons Marques &amp; Domaines USA.","44":"There is something very pure and lifted about this: right now it is so taut that it just says citrus and stone. There is something both ripe and tart, a very lemon-like freshness, with generosity and fruit. There is unusual concentration and for now, while the aromas are still tightly wound, the absolutely stony serious texture is on full display. The purity of this is astonishing and has something authentic and enticing about it. Give this time. Drink 2020\u20132040.","45":"With its few years bottle aging, this is developing into a fabulous wine. From one of the top Grand Cru vineyards in southern Alsace, it has richness while still preserving a light touch that brings out acidity and tight fruitiness. To contrast, the mineral texture adds a tense factor, very crisp and allowing the wine to age further. Drink until 2025.","46":"There is both wonderful bite and density to this great wine. It has a weighty texture full of ripe, rich fruit. At the same time, the wine is bone dry and crisp with acidity. It' s just beginning to mature, and while enjoyable now, it's better to wait until 2016.","47":"Chamomile and ripe, red-apple notes make for an appetizing nose. The palate adds lovely vivid notes of zesty tangerine to this. Aromas of hay flowers also appear on this shimmering, aromatic, tight, taut and linear Riesling. Concentration fills the mouth with wonderfully light but sure-footed brightness and flavor. The dry long finish has a grounding earthy touch. Simply wonderful. Drink 2017\u20132035.","48":"A flinty touch of promising reduction still hovers on the nose but cheeky floral and fruity hints of honeysuckle, jasmine and peach shimmer through. The palate unites all of these aromatic notions on a textured, layered and concentrated palate. The hints of honeysuckle spice are intensified by the ripe zestiness of Amalfi lemon and tangerine. The finish is dry and long, with ample refreshment from these gorgeous citrus notes. This is glorious now in its youthful exuberance but has the concentration, structure and fruit to age beautifully. Drink 2017\u20132035.","49":"One of the most satisfying wines I have had in a long time. A blend of Negro-amaro (80%) and four other red grapes crafted by the brothers Apollonio in southern Italy. Deep red with aromas of ripe black cherries, nutmeg and leather. An extraordinary wine that could probably sell in the $25 range.","50":"Elegantly structured, delicious and loaded with personality, this benchmark Nizza offers earthy aromas of truffle, leather, game, pressed violet and ripe black-skinned fruit. The aromas carry over to the savory palate, along with star anise, black cherry, mature plum and crushed mint. It's balanced by polished tannins and fresh acidity. Drink through 2025.","51":"Fragrant and loaded with finesse, this opens with aromas of wild berry, blue flower, new leather, aromatic herb and a whiff of exotic spice. The structured, elegant palate delivers layers of red cherry, strawberry, flinty mineral, orange zest, star anise and clove framed in firm, polished tannins and bright acidity. It's still young and will develop even more complexity. Drink 2019\u20132029.","52":"Radiant and earthy, this blend of Frappato and Nero d'Avola boasts enticing scents suggesting dark-skinned berry, leather, sunbaked earth, sea breeze and a floral note. The creamy, succulent palate doles out juicy black cherry, black raspberry, white pepper and aromatic herb alongside supple tannins and fresh acidity. A saline note wraps up the finish. Drink 2017\u20132024.","53":"You'll need to swirl the glass a few times to release the enticing scents of yellow stone fruit, Alpine herb and an intriguing smoky note. The savory vibrant palate is more expressive, delivering layers of crunchy green apple, zesty tangerine and juicy yellow peach set against crisp acidity. A flinty mineral note graces the lingering finish, lending even more depth. Drink through 2020.","54":"This sweet, luscious, dessert-style wine keeps enough acidity to contrast and compensate for the sugar. There's nothing flabby here, but how sweet it is! Caramel apples, molasses, maple syrup and honey coalesce around concentrated fruits, ranging from citrus through tropical. Orange and peach, pineapple and papaya are all to be found. A half bottle is rich enough to satisfy four tasters.","55":"Details of tea leaf, peach skin and pear introduce a wine with tremendous texture and length. The off-dry sweetness is counterbalanced by tart acidity, creating perfect tension and continuing into a lingering, satisfying finish. As with all these young wines, this will improve dramatically with ample aeration.","56":"This maintains a fine balance between its sugar (145 g\/L) and driving acidity. Its lemon drop, black tea, brown sugar, candied citrus and caramel flavors are bright and brilliant. The complexity and sheer deliciousness make it irresistible.","57":"The tiny Ribbon Ridge AVA is becoming well known for Oregon Riesling. This succulent, fruit-packed young wine displays impeccably clean apple, peach, pear, apricot and melon flavors. Minerally acidity keeps it lively and fresh, and its intensity and balance suggest it will age for decades. Drink now through 2035 and beyond.","58":"The Celilo vineyard has contributed the fruit to many outstanding Chardonnays from a who's who list of winemakers, but none better than this. Intensely concentrated and deeply extracted, it explodes with marvelously pure fruit flavors\u2014the full range of citrus, citrus peel and crisp tree fruits. A wine with perfect virtually balance, exceptional texture and amazing length.","59":"A phenomenally brilliant effort from this emerging superstar winery. The Merlot is enhanced with 17% Cabernet, 5% Syrah and 2% Cab Franc. You won\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt find Merlot from anywhere else in the country that shows so much supple power and structure. Vibrant fruit is polished to a fine luster with perfectly applied oak \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdseasoning\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd that adds toast, butter, coconut, cedar and smoke, lifted with scents of tobacco, citrus and leaf. You run out of superlatives for this wine.","60":"Alcohol that reaches these levels is often a complexity killer, but not here. This is a stunningly delicious wine, with ripe, powerful and concentrated black fruits. Baking spices, tar, pencil lead, even a whiff of compost all add to the complexity and the depth of flavor is magnificent. This can age at least a decade but is delicious already!","61":"Spectacular is the word that comes to mind here. Tasted over many hours, this stunning effort proved itself over and over. A mix of citrus oils, tree fruits, a hint of honey, tea, lemon verbena and more, it delivers astonishing complexity and flavor for such a young wine. It should continue to evolve and improve from 2024\u20132034.","62":"Truly stunning, the Lewis Estate Riesling from Dunham explodes with fragrant fruits\u2014citrus, melon and tropical. A symphony of subtle accents, such as powdered sugar, candied citrus peel and breakfast tea, this gorgeous bottle belongs with the short list of the very best of Washington's many Rieslings.","63":"With residual sugar at about 1.35%, this balances the acidity without seeming sweet. Hand-picked and whole-cluster pressed, this immaculate, fresh, generous and stylish Riesling is always at the top of the list of Washington's best. Loaded with grapefruit, citrus and stone flavors, it cleans the palate and piles on the details as it rolls into a finish that lingers for well over a full minute.","64":"Beautifully floral, fragrant and evocative, with lush and complex aromas of honeycomb, cracker and citrus, carrying into the mouth with rich, bright, detailed flavors. Stone and mineral elements are woven throughout, and the barrel fermentation adds hints of toast.","65":"Dark, tannic and smoky, this has more tarry tobacco flavor than the other two reds in this series. Muscular, dense and tight, it offers cassis, raspberry and sappy, delicious red fruits. This is very young, very tight, but already nuanced with extraordinary notes of leaf and clean herb. It'll be interesting to see where it goes in 5\u201310 years.","66":"Among McCrea's Rh\u00f4ne-inspired white wines, this is the most complete and complex. It's rich and dense, with honeycomb, lychee, lemon rind, pineapple and lots of stone\u2014lovely and lingering. It seems to gain strength as it rolls through a sensational finish.","67":"Sophisticated winemaking meets gorgeous fruit in this unusual blend: 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Syrah, 20% Merlot and 20% Cab Franc. The Syrah's fresh citrus flavors are perfect in the context of the sappy Merlot and harder Cabs, making a wonderful blend that is immediately accessible with sweet, round fruit; then  lingers into a long, textured, lively finish.","68":"Simply sensational, this estate-grown Viognier raises the bar for everyone.
