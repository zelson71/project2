A lovely, engulfing apple tartness makes this as suited to baked fruit desserts and fruit tarts as to creamy, ripe cheeses. Full marks for poise and freshness.

It is only on the palate that the richer and sweeter Auslese character comes to bear—again in the guise of dark, aromatic pine honey. The concentrated, deliciously bitter zestiness of the acidity, paired with the aromatically dark and equally bitter edge of the resinous honey provide a wonderful structure. While sweetness peaks up, it never gains the upper hand. This is a tight-rope walker of a wine with immense balance and poise.

Layers of honey, orange and spice coat the tongue in a sumptuous wave, but the wine still has a delicate quality that begs for another glass.
