Juicy, thick and rich on the palate, the wine has a grip and power that never lets go, showing its youth and 100% barrel fermentation. It will be hard to wait on this one, but cellaring will reward. Best 2024–2034."

Black licorice and crushed stone add to its overall complexity and curious nature, the fruit extracted and pure."

Full bodied and robustly built, there's a wealth of power and flavor here, from coconut to black cherry. It's built to age. Best 2023–2030."

The finish offers length and plenty of power. This bold wine will do well in the cellar. Best 2024–2030."

Dark and thick in the glass, it begins with aromas of stewed black plums, burned beef, tar and teriyaki, yet with the lift of violets. The palate shows similar cohesive qualities, from dark fruit to roasted game, and is leveled by dramatic black-pepper spice and a bright acidity."

From the famous Philippe Melka, this 100% Cab pours inky black, and smells dramatically oaked. No surprise that it's 100% new French barrels. But the underlying wine is massive in blackberry, cherry, mocha, lavender and thyme, just gigantically proportioned, and easily able to handle all that wood. Beautiful now, it's a keeper. Drink now–2018."
15307,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court 2005 Land's Edge Vineyards Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),US,45,96,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/hartford-court-2005-lands-edge-vineyards-pinot-noir-sonoma-coast/,"Most of the grapes came from the Annapolis Vineyard, with some from Seascape. While the vintage was cool, it gave incredibly long hangtime. Dry, crisp and delicate, the wine has a silky voluptuousness that makes it irresistible, with pie-filling cherry and black raspberry flavors finished with Asian spice. New French oak adds toast and vanilla sweetness. It's expensive, but still a bargain."
15308,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clos Pegase 2002 Graveyard Hill Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Carneros),US,60,96,2002,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/clos-pegase-2002-graveyard-hill-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-sonoma-carneros/,"This shows crisp acids and fine balance. It's huge in blackberry and cherry fruit, but has the structural integrity and finesse that, quite simply, make it a very great Cabernet Sauvignon. Drink now–2015."
15310,Pinot Noir,W.H. Smith 2005 Maritime Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),US,52,98,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/wh-smith-2005-maritime-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-coast/,"The first thoughts on this wine are how young it is, and how much potential it shows. The immaturity lies in the primary fruit, acidic character, like a big gulp of fruity cola. But the wine's awesome future is in its vast complexity and balance, and the way it dominates the palate and lasts and lasts. A blend of several vineyards, it's high in acidity, with massive cherry, pomegranate, rhubarb preserve, licorice, earthy mushroom and cedar flavors. So balanced and dry, so elegant and powerful, so silky and complex, it is quite simply a very great Pinot Noir, and an early indication that the vintage on the far Sonoma Coast may be the greatest ever. Tasted twice."
15311,Cabernet Sauvignon,Coup de Foudre 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,75,98,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/coup-foudre-2004-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"This wine is from John Schwartz, who partners with Heidi Peterson Barrett to make Amuse Bouche. For Coup de Foudre, he has paired with Danielle Price, MS, and wine director at Wynn Las Vegas, to produce this stunning Cabernet, which contains 12% Syrah. Grown in a 5-acre Stags Leap District vineyard, it shows stunning levels of blackberry and chocolate fruit enhanced with waves of smoky oak. Yet somehow, for all the opulence and power, there's an almost weightless elegance to the wine. Sometimes cult Cabs can lack restraint, be too obvious. This one teases with richness, then pulls back under a velvety cover of tannin. A major debut."
16172,Pinot Noir,Ken Wright 2005 Abbott Claim Pinot Noir (Yamhill-Carlton),US,50,95,2005,Oregon,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/ken-wright-2005-abbott-claim-pinot-noir-willamette-valley-yamhill-carlton-district/,"This outstanding vineyard comes through again with a full, fleshy, almost beefy wine. Powerful red fruits are enhanced with subtle flavors of citrus, juniper, pine needle, dried herbs and mint. Elegant and complex, the fruit from these young vines shows power and grace. Most surprisingly, the finish actually gains strength as it lingers. The sweet black cherry flavor seems to last forever."

Secondary aromas are of vanilla, licorice and toast; the wine is amazingly lively in the mouth with voluptuous, liquid chocolate-like flavors and an extra-long finish."
16366,Syrah,Foley 2004 Rancho Santa Rosa Syrah (Sta.

Erupts with cascades of white pepper, violets, cassis, plum pudding, rum, molasses, sweet kid leather, root beer and more. In the mouth, the primary fruit is black cherries and kirsch, while the new oak and glycerine makes for a rich, honeyed, almost unguent mouthfeel. Decant if you open it now; should gain additional complexities in the next eight years. Editors' Choice."

What a wonderful bouquet this has developed, offering floral hints, notes of black olive and bright mulberry and blueberry fruit. This is still very youthful and incredibly packed with flavor. Although it seems creamy at first, it firms up on the finish, showing more iron-like minerality on the finish. Hold."
16369,Pinot Noir,Gary Farrell 2004 Rochioli-Allen Vineyards Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),US,65,95,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/gary-farrell-2004-rochioli-allen-pinot-noir-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"These vineyards are, of course, very famous, among the oldest and more respected in Russian River. Gary Farrell has long had access to their coveted fruit and 2004 is one of his greatest bottlings ever. It may be due to the warm vintage, but the fruit is spectacular, not in your face at the expense of balance, and rich in cherries, cola and cinnamon-infused rum punch. This is a young, vibrant, crisp Pinot Noir, with a good life ahead for the next 10 years."
16370,Pinot Noir,Longoria 2005 Fe Ciega Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),US,48,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/longoria-2005-fe-ciega-vineyard-pinot-noir-central-coast-sta-rita-hills/,"You'd never guess the power from the pale color. A multi-clone blend, it impresses from the first sniff, all puréed ripe cherries and strawberries, leading to a dramatically fruited, fresh, pure and vibrant mouthfeel. Should hold and improve for a decade."
16372,Pinot Noir,Fess Parker 2005 Ashley's Vineyard Clone 115 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),US,50,96,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/fess-parker-2005-ashleys-vineyard-clone-115-pinot-noir-central-coast-sta-rita-hills/,"This single-clone barrel selection takes the essence of the gorgeous, regular '05 Ashley's and concentrates it. Brims with sautéed Portobello mushroom, tamari, tangerine zest and black cherry preserves, leading to an immaculately rich, delicately silky, nuanced and enormously complicated Pinot. Hard to exaggerate the purity and finesse. Drink now–2012, before the lush fruit fades."

It is a magnificent wine, packed with sweet fruit, bold strokes of flavor, a stream of tannin and red fruit acidity at the end. It should age well, and long. Imported by Henriot, Inc."
16975,Pinot Noir,Domaine Drouhin-Laroze 2004  Clos de Vougeot,France,149,95,2004,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-drouhin-laroze-2004-pinot-noir-clos-vougeot/,"Philippe Drouhin has produced a monumental Clos de Vougeot. It has power, intensity and great, solid fruit flavors, particularly black plums. Add spice, some wood, delicious acidity and concentration—this wine will age for years."

It shows the power of the grape, the structural verticality, the austerity, but it is also ripe enough to stand alone and shine all by itself. This is a perfectly sculpted wine, elegant and fine, sleek and muscular. It needs time, no doubt, but it's delicious right now as well. I just love pure Cabernet. It's like a zen wine."
16978,Merlot,Blankiet 2004 Merlot (Napa Valley),US,100,95,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/blankiet-2004-merlot-napa-valley/,"This is a stunning Merlot, impossibly rich. Saturated and opaque in color, it tastes fat and flashy, with masses of cherry and blackberry jam, anise, chocolate and Provençal herb flavors. Yet this opulently soft wine has a classic structure, backed up with firm tannins. This is a profound Merlot."
16979,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père &amp; Fils 2004 Chambertin-Clos-de-Bèze  (Chambertin Clos de Bèze),France,235,95,2004,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bouchard-pere-fils-2004-chambertin-clos-beze-pinot-noir-chambertin-clos-beze/,"Rich, generous, almost opulent, this brings together great layers of black fruits and figs, wood smoothness and dense, sensual ripeness allied to acidity. There's power here, too, but it's a wine to revel in."
16980,Pinot Noir,Louis Jadot 2004  Bonnes-Mares,France,128,95,2004,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/louis-jadot-2004-pinot-noir-bonnes-mares/,"In keeping with its place on the boundary of Morey Saint-Denis and Chambolle-Musigny, this Bonnes-Mares marries the refinement of great Chambolle with the more tough, powered character of Morey. It's smoky, powerful and solid with an explosion of fruits in the mouth, but leaving mouth-watering freshness to finish."
16981,Pinot Noir,Domaine Anne Gros 2004 Le Grand Maupertui  (Clos de Vougeot),France,120,95,2004,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-anne-gros-2004-le-grand-maupertui-pinot-noir-clos-vougeot/,"Anne Gros calls her share of this parcel in Clos Vougeot Maupertui—her cousin Michel spells it “Maupertuis.” Such are the complications of Burgundy. But this wine is anything but a confusion: It's a powerful, beautifully constructed wine, everything in its place—fruit, tannins and smoky wood. This justifies the sometimes questionable place of Clos Vougeot among the Grand Crus."
16982,Pinot Noir,Domaine Jean Grivot 2004 Richebourg  (Richebourg),France,375,95,2004,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-jean-grivot-2004-richebourg-pinot-noir-richebourg/,"This will need years to develop fully—15 to 20 years probably. For now, it is firmly tannic, very dry and powerful, with juicy fruit and acidity somewhere in there. The elements are not yet knitted together. When they are, this will be a stupendous wine."
16983,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Pride Mountain 2003 Reserve Claret Red (Napa-Sonoma),US,120,95,2003,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/pride-mountain-2003-reserve-claret-red-north-coast-napa-sonoma/,"If you're lucky enough to try this with Pride's reserve Cab, which is 100% varietal, you'll find this one fleshier and meatier. Based on Merlot, it shows a voluptuous fatness, a chocolate-covered cherry candy immediacy, that makes it drinkable now. At the same time, it has big, dusty, mouth-coating tannins. Drink now, with decanting, or cellar for 10 years."
16984,Pinot Noir,Domaine Drouhin-Laroze 2004 Chambertin-Clos-de-Bèze  (Chambertin Clos de Bèze),France,169,95,2004,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-drouhin-laroze-2004-chambertin-clos-beze-pinot-noir-chambertin-clos-beze/,"This wine is all power on a leash. It is a wine that is waiting to escape from its youth, there's that much intensity. It's not huge, but it is concentrated, and the black fruits and acidity are already powering through. It needs 5–6 years."
16985,Pinot Noir,Joseph Drouhin 2004  Clos de la Roche,France,112,95,2004,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/joseph-drouhin-2004-pinot-noir-clos-roche/,"Great power, delicious fruit and dusty tannins are all present in an elegant parcel. This is an impressive wine, with a balanced structure and texture. And the fruit is so ripe, so seductive without going over the top. Drink in 2012."

And just when you think it's all up front, the tannins creep up and promise great aging potential."
16988,Pinot Noir,Domaine de la Romanée-Conti 2004 Romanée-Saint-Vivant  (Romanée-St.-Vivant),France,NULL,95,2004,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-la-romanee-conti-2004-saint-vivant-pinot-noir-romanee-st-vivant/,"A delicious, flowery, aromatic wine. The flavors float around the firm core of fine tannins, plum skin and fig flavors, combining with acidity and leaving an impression of delicacy, yet also great aging potential."

It's balanced, but what's hard to describe is how the wine can be silky and airy, yet dense and complex. The fruit is amazingly ripe, a detonation of cherries, cola, raspberries, pomegranates and coffee, with new oaky layers of caramel, toast and vanilla, but it all comes together in a seamless, elegant, complex experience that's a joy to savor. Terrific now. Should hit its peak in 2007–2009, and hold for a decade."
16991,Cabernet Blend,Joseph Phelps 2003 Insignia Red (Napa Valley),US,165,96,2003,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/joseph-phelps-2003-insignia-red-napa-valley/,"One of the first, if not the first, of the proprietarily named Napa Bordeaux blends, Phelps Insignia has been one of California's greatest Cabs for decades. This is their 30th anniversary bottling, and it's worthy of the tradition. Ultrarich and smooth, with a mouthfeel that's pure velvet, it's fairly thick in tannins now, suggesting cellaring. But it's huge in blackberry, dark unsweetened chocolate and spicy plum fruit, and will easily hold for a very long time. Best now, if carefully decanted, and through 2020."
16992,Pinot Noir,Louis Jadot 2004 Chambertin Clos de Bèze  (Chambertin Clos de Bèze),France,152,96,2004,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/louis-jadot-2004-chambertin-clos-beze-pinot-noir-chambertin-clos-beze/,"If you ever needed to know why Grand Crus are better vineyards and make better wine than the rest, this wine is the perfect example. It has all the richness and opulence of great Pinot Noir, but at the same time, with its firm structure and plum and damson flavors, it magnifies those qualities into something impressive and long-lasting."
16993,Pinot Noir,Domaine de la Romanée-Conti 2004 La Tâche  (La Tâche),France,NULL,96,2004,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-la-romanee-conti-2004-tache-pinot-noir-tache/,"Although this wine is very firm and closed at the outset, it opens—and keeps opening in the mouth—to offer great fruit flavors. It is finely balanced, very pure, combining an ethereal character with the proper feet-in-the-soil taste of great Pinot Noir. Age for 20 years, if you can bear to wait."
16994,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem 2004 Precious Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),US,85,96,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/williams-selyem-2004-precious-mountain-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-coast/,"This is always one of Williams Selyems' best Pinots, and the '04 is a fabulous wine. The grapes got real ripe up there in the coastal mountains, producing complex blackberry, cherry, cola, rhubarb, pomegranate and spice flavors, but the cool nights preserved vital acidity, and that makes for a rich balance. The wine never gives up its basically silky, elegant mouthfeel. So savory and delicious now, it's hard to pass up, but this wine should improve for six years."
16995,Syrah,Cayuse 2004 Bionic Frog Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),US,75,96,2004,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/cayuse-2004-bionic-frog-shiraz-syrah-syrah-columbia-valley-walla-walla-wa/,"Smooth, supple and full-flavored, The Bionic Frog shows the characteristic uber-funk that it is known for. But in this new vintage it seems to be a bit less in-your-face than previously. There's plenty of wild herb, beef blood and silage to go around; but the flavors are already fully integrated, the wine viscous and plush with an intensely spicy quality. This is beautiful, thick and meaty yet still lifted through the finish, which keeps adding new scents and flavors as it sails along-vanilla, clove and baking spices."
16996,Syrah,Cayuse 2003 Armada Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),US,65,97,2003,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/cayuse-2003-armada-shiraz-syrah-syrah-columbia-valley-walla-walla-wa/,"A truly stunning wine of amazing complexity. It has layers of depth rarely found in any Washington wines, beginning with dense black fruits, black licorice, smoke, pepper and charcoal. The trademark Cayuse herbal/green tea elements are there also, more as hints than as layers. The aging in big neutral barriques has buffed it out; as it breathes in the glass the wine opens beautifully, gaining flesh and density. A genuine tour de force, deeply aromatic and fascinating."
16997,Pinot Noir,Domaine des Lambrays 2004 Clos des Lambrays  (Clos de Lambrays),France,110,97,2004,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-lambrays-2004-clos-pinot-noir-clos-lambrays/,"To say this is textbook Pinot Noir is to do this stunning wine an injustice. But it does have everything that should be in a great Pinot Noir—the sumptuousness, the silky tannins, the touch of wood, the red fruits. All of these are enveloped in an elegant structure, leaving freshness and delicious, refreshing acidity at the end."
16999,Pinot Noir,Domaine de la Romanée-Conti 2004  Romanée-Conti,France,NULL,97,2004,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-la-romanee-conti-2004-pinot-noir-romanee-conti/,"This wine's considerable power derives from its a solid texture, its multifaceted red-berry flavors, juiciness, freshness and perfect balancing acidity. You can, and will want to, hold this in the mouth for many minutes. It is a complete wine."
17520,Cabernet Sauvignon,Caymus 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,70,95,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/caymus-2004-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"Here's an extraordinary wine to add to your cellar collection. It's a guaranteed ager. Supported by rich, sturdy tannins, it shows a firm, dry mouthfeel and deep flavors of blackberries, with a seamless hem of toasty oak. So balanced, so powerful and elegant, it's at the top of its class, and proves that the floor of the Napa Valley can produce great Cabernet. Drink now–2020."
17677,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vine Cliff 2003 16 Rows Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),US,135,95,2003,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/vine-cliff-2003-16-rows-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-oakville/,"This is Vine Cliff's highest designation Cab, and it just keeps getting better and better. It's a very serious wine. Shows its Oakville origins in the ripe blackberry and currant flavors, extraordinary balance and elegant power, but the tannins are fairly tough at this time. It's nothing that decanting and good beef can't handle, but this dense, complex wine should soften and improve over the next decade."
17686,Tinta de Toro,Numanthia 2003 Termanthia  (Toro),Spain,201,96,2003,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/numanthia-termes-sl-2003-termanthia-tempranillo-tinta-de-toro-toro/,"Sly in the early innings and then menthol, forest, spice, charcoal and earthy black-fruit aromas emerge to rally this bruiser into its prime, which entails monster fruit flavors, rugged tannins, and a stout, peppery finish. The core power on this wine is beyond reproach. Will cellar nicely for at least five years, possibly more."
17689,Cabernet Blend,The Maiden 2003 Red (Napa Valley),US,110,96,2003,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/maiden-2003-red-napa-valley/,"This second label of Harlan Estate comes from the estate vineyard, and shares much in common with the main wine, which is a bit more focused and concentrated. The similarities include the briary, wild herb scents of sage and thyme that complex the ripe red cherry pie filling fruit, cocoa, cola and licorice. As with the main wine, the tannins here are gorgeous. This is a balanced, harmonious wine that combines power and elegance."
17692,Cabernet Blend,BOND 2003 Vecina Red (Napa Valley),US,230,96,2003,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bond-2003-vecina-red-napa-valley/,"From a vineyard just adjacent to the Oakville estate comes this wonderfully earth-scented wine. Deep and brooding, the aromas bring to mind a walk through a forest. Now a whiff of bay laurel, then pine cone and a rich, mulchy humus, and hovering over all are ripe blackberries and oodles of caramelized new oak. Much more open at this point in its life than the '02, but should live for many years."
17693,Cabernet Blend,BOND 2003 St. Eden Red (Napa Valley),US,230,96,2003,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bond-2003-st-eden-red-napa-valley/,"Tasted alongside the Melbury, St. Eden is richer, more layered and complex. The jammy cherry and chocolate flavors here possess deeper notes of blue and purple fruits, with a brooding, mulchy depth that grounds the wine. The texture is gorgeous, with perfectly ripe, sweet tannins. Despite the wine's power, it has an airy, cloud-like quality, surely the mark of a great wine."
17698,Cabernet Blend,Harlan Estate 2003 Red (Napa Valley),US,265,98,2003,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/harlan-estate-2003-red-napa-valley/,"Another spectacular Harlan hits the market. It shows the earthy quality that marks wines off the estate, with an aroma suggesting a warm bale of hay under the summer sun, a sweet straw and bay laurel scent that adds savory richness to the cherry, blackberry and chocolate flavors. As usual, the tannins are virtual perfection, at once sweet and firm, dense and fine, perfectly in balance with all the fruit and new oak. So young now, a fat little baby of a wine that's irresistible, but will hold and improve well beyond its tenth birthday."
18574,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beaulieu Vineyard 2003 Georges de Latour Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,95,95,2003,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/beaulieu-vineyard-2003-georges-latour-private-reserve-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"Just classic Georges, balanced, elegant and refined, hiding its power under a blanket of controlled finesse. There's great depth of flavor, with oodles of blackberry, cherry and raspberry, mocha, Chinese plum sauce, soy and spicy oak, wrapped in firm, dry tannins. Just wonderful now, but with the certainty of a long life ahead. Drink–2020."
18575,Pinot Noir,Tantara 2004 Bien Nacido Vineyard Old Vine Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),US,45,95,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/tantara-2004-bien-nacido-vineyard-old-vine-pinot-noir-central-coast-santa-maria-valley/,"This is a brilliant wine that defines Bien Nacido, the coast, and California Pinot Noir. There were worries about the heat, but somehow this has ended up balanced, dry and classically elegant, maybe because of vine age; they're now 36-years- old. Impresses for the power of its cherry pie filling, mocha, rum and cola and spicebox flavors that finish dry and complex, with the longest, most wonderfully complex finish. Drink now–2010."
18577,Corvina,Masi 2000 Mazzano  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),Italy,140,95,2000,Veneto,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/masi-2000-mazzano-red-amarone-della-valpolicella-classico/,"Shows more leather and cedar than the Campolongo di Torbe, but even more richness and intensity. Slightly pruny, dried-fruit notes are accompanied by hints of apricot, game and dried spices. Lush and long on the finish; the best of the 2000s. It's approachable, but age-worthy."
18579,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield 2004 McDougall Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),US,52,95,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/dutton-goldfield-2004-mcdougall-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-coast/,"What a wonderful Pinot Noir, a joy to sip as it warms and changes in the glass. It's a very young wine, dry, sappy and acidic, with a tremendous depth of cherry preserves, licorice, cocoa, oaky spice and something wild and mushroomy that comes from the earth. As good as it is now, it should improve for a decade."
18581,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rubicon Estate 2003 Cask Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),US,65,95,2003,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/rubicon-estate-2003-cask-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-rutherford/,"I always think of Francis Coppola's Cask Cabernet as his hommage to the old Inglenook. It's 100% varietal, grown at the Rutherford estate, and a spectacular wine. Enormously oaky now, with an explosion of char and vanilla, it shows an underworld of black currants, and is huge in sweet, youthful tannins. Yet those tannins are so polished, so refined. This is a glamorous wine, tremendous now, and will hold and develop through 2020."
18582,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pine Ridge 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),US,80,95,2003,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/pine-ridge-2003-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-howell-mountain/,"Huge, just tremendous and authoritative. Aged in new, high-toast oak for 17 months, it bursts with smoky char and caramelized vanilla, while the underlying fruit explodes with spicy plum, wild blackberry marmalade and chocolate. The tannins are very strong, but ripely sweet and finely meshed. A guaranteed cellar candidate, it should slowly improve for a decade, and last another decade beyond that."
18583,Cabernet Sauvignon,Fielding Hills 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Wahluke Slope),US,30,95,2004,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/fielding-hills-2004-cabernet-sauvignon-columbia-valley-wahluke-slope/,"Dark, tannic and smoky, this has more tarry tobacco flavor than the other two reds in this series. Muscular, dense and tight, it offers cassis, raspberry and sappy, delicious red fruits. This is very young, very tight, but already nuanced with extraordinary notes of leaf and clean herb. It'll be interesting to see where it goes in 5–10 years."
18585,Cabernet Blend,Iron Horse 2003 T-bar-T Benchmark Red (Alexander Valley),US,70,96,2003,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/iron-horse-2003-t-bar-t-benchmark-red-sonoma-alexander-valley/,"This is a gorgeous wine, a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. It's light and delicate, but powerful, and boasts delicious cherry pie, cassis, cocoa, char and spice flavors. It possesses the kind of tannins that are soft and sweet now, but firm enough to hold the wine for many years. Best now, or anytime through 2015."
18588,Pinot Noir,Joseph Drouhin 2003  Clos de Vougeot,France,NULL,96,2003,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/joseph-drouhin-2003-pinot-noir-clos-vougeot/,"A superbly ripe wine, full of rich tense tannins and big black fruits. There is a depth of flavor in this wine which is remarkable, focusing on a dry structure, very rich fruit, layers of wood and a finishing fresh acidity. This is a wine which will age over many years."
18590,Corvina,Masi 1990 Mazzano  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),Italy,NULL,97,1990,Veneto,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/masi-1990-mazzano-red-amarone-della-valpolicella-classico/,"This is wonderfully integrated and complex, offering a dizzying array of spices that blend seamlessly with notes of leather and cherries. Wonderfully velvety in texture and round in the mouth, but also boasting a long, spice-filled finish. A tremendous effort. Drink now–2020."
18591,Pinot Noir,Tantara 2004 Evelyn Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),US,80,97,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/tantara-2004-evelyn-pinot-noir-central-coast-santa-maria-valley/,"Stunning. Just magnificent. This is from Tantara's little Bien Nacido block. It achieves wonderfully ripe fruit flavors with clean, balancing tannins and acids to produce the utmost California cool-climate Pinot Noir. Cherries, raspberries, cola, rich new oak and Asian spice flavors all flood the palate, wrapped into a dramatic silky, velvety texture. This is great Pinot Noir."
20175,Red Blend,Marchesi Antinori 2000 Guado al Tasso  (Bolgheri Superiore),Italy,80,95,2000,Tuscany,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/marchesi-antinori-2000-guado-al-tasso-red-bolgheri-superiore/,"This wine towers over others in terms of excellence. This blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 10% Syrah and other varieties (that sees 14 months of barrique) is the epitome of grace and elevates wine drinking to almost spiritual heights: The nose is horizontal, wide, vast and infinite with extraordinary tobacco, leather with fine cherry at its core and toasted almond and herbal notes at the extremities. The palate is treated to soft tones of vanilla, silky tannins and overall finesse that can be savored over long minutes."
20234,Merlot,Quilceda Creek 2003 Merlot (Washington),US,65,95,2003,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/quilceda-creek-2003-merlot-other/,"Oaky, toasty and spicy, this thick, massive Merlot is packed with berries, cherries, plums and chocolate. The Cab Franc adds meaty tannins to the beautiful blueberry, blue plum and blackberry fruit. A sweet, supple Merlot with hints of coffee, black tea and earth. Makes you wish Quilceda made more of it."
20239,Syrah,Delas Frères 2003 Les Bessards  (Hermitage),France,146,95,2003,Rhône Valley,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/delas-freres-2003-bessards-shiraz-syrah-syrah-hermitage/,"Incredibly rich, velvety-textured and long, this is a great example of Hermitage from a superripe vintage. It's dense like fruitcake without being excessively heavy, and boasts such a panopoly of nuance as to be spellbinding, ranging from spice and herb to black olive and espresso. Wow! Drink now–2025."
20240,Pinot Noir,Longoria 2004 Fe Ciega Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),US,43,95,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/longoria-2004-fe-ciega-vineyard-pinot-noir-central-coast-sta-rita-hills/,"Firm in acids, with some tannins, yet not at all hard. This is a magnificent, masculine Pinot Noir. It floods the palate with cherry pie, cola and mocha flavors, Asian spices and a sweet, smoky, buttery phyllo pastry quality. So technically perfect, with such structure, it seems guaranteed for the cellar. Drink now through 2010, but who knows how long it will last."
20242,Syrah,Andrew Will 2002 Annie Camarda Syrah (Red Mountain),US,58,95,2002,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/andrew-will-2002-annie-camarda-shiraz-syrah-syrah-columbia-valley-red-mountain/,"An extraordinary Syrah, from Ciel du Cheval grapes. It's supple and silky, yet retains classic fresh raspberry, cherry and boysenberry fruit that's bright and crisply defined by natural acids. The panoply of flavors is seamlessly woven into chocolaty tannins, with a final kick of gravelly minerality."
22082,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Leonetti Cellar 2003 Reserve Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),US,100,95,2003,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/leonetti-cellar-2003-reserve-red-columbia-valley-walla-walla-wa/,"100% estate grown. More tannic and dense than the Cabernet, this is roughly three-quarters Cabernet, one-sixth Merlot, but replaces that wine's Cab Franc and Carmenère with Petit Verdot. The nose shows hints of mushroom, jasmine, blueberries, raspberries and dark chocolate. All in all a big but surprisingly subtle, scented, sensuous wine."
22086,Cabernet Sauvignon,Quilceda Creek 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington),US,95,97,2003,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/quilceda-creek-2003-cabernet-sauvignon-other/,"Lovely color and aromatics, this supremely powerful yet graceful wine sends up a mix of plum, berry, dust, mint and menthol. It's spicy and young, and surprisingly light on its feet. The concentration here is different from a top-tier Napa Cabernet; the fruit has a pleasing elegance. The acids are firm but unobtrusive, the tannins are ripe, smooth but substantial, giving the wine some weight and power. As good as anything this superb producer has ever done."
22498,Cabernet Sauvignon,Baldacci 2003 Brenda's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),US,70,95,2003,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/baldacci-2003-brendas-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-stags-leap-district/,"Tasted with Baldacci's regular Cab, this is a slightly tougher, less immediately opulent wine. The fruit is there, but the tannic structure makes it less accessible. Lush plum and prune flavors coat the palate, dusted with oaky notes of chocolate and smoke. Winemaker Rolando Herrera worked at Stag's Leap Wine Cellars as well as with Paul Hobbs, and he clearly knows his stuff. If you can cellar this 100% Cab though 2010, good for you, because it's just so rewarding now."
22499,Cabernet Blend,BOND 2002 Melbury Red (Napa Valley),US,225,95,2002,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bond-2002-melbury-red-napa-valley/,"Enormously rich, like biting into a warm chocolate truffle with a cherry-blackberry core. Ultrasmooth, a bit soft and melted, but oh, so supple and velvety, with fine, firm tannins. Completely dry and balanced, this is a wine of harmonious complexity."
22502,Cabernet Blend,Robert Young 2002 Scion Red (Alexander Valley),US,54,95,2002,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/robert-young-2002-scion-red-sonoma-alexander-valley/,"The Youngs produce a stunning Cabernet from their vineyard on the eastern benchlands of the valley. This Cab is the polar opposite of Napa, and defines the alternative possibilities. Soft, intricate and herbal-earthy, it has beautiful black cherry, cocoa, tobacco and new oak flavors, and it's thoroughly dry. Drink now through 2015."
22503,Cabernet Blend,BOND 2002 Vecina Red (Napa Valley),US,225,95,2002,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bond-2002-vecina-red-napa-valley/,"Based on Oakville fruit, Vecina is not quite as fruit-driven as the other two Bond wines. It's a bit backward, with an earthy, mushroomy, soy and balsamic taste alongside the briary berry flavors. Has an almost feral quality that is quite interesting and different. With its big backsplash of tannins, it might age best of the current trio. Drink now–2020."
22504,Cabernet Sauvignon,Colgin 2003 Herb Lamb Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,225,95,2003,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/colgin-2003-herb-lamb-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"Almost black in color. Flavors are of blackberry, cassis, Provençal herbs; the 100% new oak adds rich toast and char notes. Tannins are brilliant, dense and fluffy. Grown at the base of Howell Mountain, this is classic mountain Cab, beautiful now, fleshy and fat, but with a 20-year lifespan."
22505,Cabernet Sauvignon,Shafer 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,55,95,2003,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/shafer-2003-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"Enormously rich in crème de cassis, cherry pie and cocoa flavors, which many Cabs have these days. But what's so special is the tannic structure, which is world class, and could only come from a premier Napa vineyard. This is an amazingly delicious wine, a joy to drink, but it's best enjoyed now and for a year or three, to appreciate its youthful opulence."
22506,Pinot Noir,Le Cadeau 2003 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),US,40,95,2003,Oregon,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/le-cadeau-2003-pinot-noir-willamette-valley/,"What a spectacular effort. Dense and precise, it explodes from the glass with pure varietal scents and crisp, layered flavors. The mix of red fruits seamlessly weaves into barrel flavors of coffee, toast, caramel and buttered nuts, then adds licorice and spice to the long, clean,  lifted finish. A tour de force."
22507,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Colgin 2003 Cariad Red (Napa Valley),US,225,95,2003,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/colgin-2003-cariad-red-napa-valley/,"A Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, the grapes for this stunning wine came from David Abreu's vineyard in the St. Helena foothills. It's very complex, softer, more open and approachable than Colgin's 100% Cabs, with a flamboyant spectrum of cherries,  framboise, cocoa, violets, gingerbread and spices framed in supple, fine tannins. Beautiful, a feminine wine of great beauty. Drink now through 2015."
22508,Cabernet Blend,Screaming Eagle 2003 Red Wine Red (Oakville),US,500,96,2003,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/screaming-eagle-2003-red-wine-napa-oakville/,"Ripe and flashy, offering tiers of cassis, chocolate and charry new oak flavors, wrapped in sweet, smooth tannins. Has an acidic bite midpalate that balances the lushness, and will add to the wine's cellar-worthiness. Defines sheer power, but never loses control. Best now and through 2017, at least."
22509,Cabernet Blend,BOND 2002 St. Eden Red (Napa Valley),US,225,96,2002,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bond-2002-st-eden-red-napa-valley/,"More structured than the Melbury, with deeper, firmer tannins: but it's certainly not a tannic, hard wine. It's the quality of the tannins, fine, ripely sweet, intricate. The flavors are enormously rich in blue and black berries, as well as chocolate. Magnificent wine, fleshy, fat, opulent. As delicious as it is now, should age well through 2020."
22510,Cabernet Sauvignon,Araujo 2002 Eisele Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,185,96,2002,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/araujo-2002-eisele-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"Stunning. Explodes with the most intricately detailed aromas: a perfume of fine smoky oak and ripe black currants. Exudes sheer power, with great weight yet no heaviness. Lush and delicious, but just tannic enough. If you can wait, cellar until 2008, it should hold and improve for many years."
22511,Cabernet Blend,Robert Foley 2003 Claret Red (Napa Valley),US,110,96,2003,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/robert-foley-2003-claret-red-napa-valley/,"Nearly 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, this firm young wine showcases Napa Cab at its best. It's powerful in cassis and mocha flavors, with complex spice notes. The considerable new oak fits in fine given the wine's size. Extraordinarily smooth and lush, it's beautiful now, but has the  structure to age for a decade. What a beauty."
22513,Cabernet Sauvignon,Shafer 2002 Hillside Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),US,190,97,2002,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/shafer-2002-hillside-select-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-stags-leap-district/,"The impression is of a young, tannicly closed but enormously promising Cabernet. Floods the mouth with dramatic black currant, cherry and chocolate flavors, masses of toasty, caramelized new oak, and a rich, minerally earthiness. For all the power, there's elegance and refinement. If you must drink it now, decant it; best 2008–2015."
22514,Cabernet Blend,Rubicon Estate 2002 Red (Rutherford),US,110,98,2002,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/rubicon-estate-2002-red-napa-rutherford/,"Fragrant, showing cascades of violets, caramelized new oak, sweet cherry pie, cocoa and cassis aromas. In the mouth, it's unctuous, and floods the palate with sweet, savory flavors. Has a youthful jamminess right now, which will melt off and refine as time goes by. Such is the elegance and balance that cellaring it for 20 years will be no problem. This is the best Rubicon ever."
22515,Cabernet Blend,Harlan Estate 2002 Red (Napa Valley),US,245,99,2002,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/harlan-estate-2002-red-napa-valley/,"The aroma is deep and inviting, equal parts new oak, Cabernet fruit and dried herbs. Has tremendous weight, with red and black cherry, cola, chocolate, cassis and roasted coconut flavors. Brilliant now, virtually flawless and totally delicious, yet has the impeccable balance to age and even improve over the years. The listed price is its pre-release price. Drink now through at least 2020."
22516,Cabernet Blend,Sloan 2002 Red Wine Red (Rutherford),US,245,100,2002,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/sloan-2002-red-wine-napa-rutherford/,"Impossibly aromatic. Hard to imagine greater claret perfume. Shows the most refined mingling of smoky oak, cassis, cherries, roasted coconut macaroon, cocoa puff and spice scents. Absolutely first rate, as good as anything Napa Valley produces. Compellingly, addictively delicious, but so dry and voluptuous. Classic wine, with perfect alignment of fruit, acids, tannins, oak, alcohol, the works. The grapes are from Sloan's portion of the Sacrashe Vineyard, high above the Silverado Trail in the Vaca Mountains. Mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, aged in 100% new French oak. Perfection in a bottle. Drink now–2020."
22670,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Colgin 2003 IX Estate Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),US,175,98,2003,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/colgin-2003-ix-estate-red-wine-napa-valley/,"From the winery's estate vineyard, high up on Pritchard Hill above the Silverado Trail, comes this spectacular Cab-based masterpiece. The color is purple-black, and massively saturated. Very intricate, complex, totally enjoyable, almost perfect. Like a great Pauillac, this monumental wine announces cassis, blackberry, cigar box, pencil lead, spice and cedar flavors that go on and on. Very tannic, but so beautiful, and amazingly rich. Decant if you're drinking now, or open anytime through 2020."
22671,Red Blend,Von Strasser 2002 Reserve Red (Diamond Mountain District),US,100,97,2002,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/von-strasser-2002-reserve-red-napa-diamond-mountain-district/,"Some great Cabs are drinkable when young, while others require patience. This is the latter sort. It's a tough, young wine, dominated by dusty tannins leading to an astringent finish. But it's incredibly fine, showing a balance and grace rare even in Napa Valley. As it warms up and breathes in the glass, it gets even better, giving tantalizing hints of ripe cassis and cherries that now are buried. You could open it now, after decanting, but it should begin to blossom in 2008, and will improve for many years."
22672,Red Blend,Niebaum-Coppola 1997 Rubicon Red (Rutherford),US,100,97,1997,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/niebaum-coppola-1997-rubicon-red-napa-rutherford/,"A masterpiece from this near perfect vintage. Completely ripe, classic and fresh, with oodles of red cherry and blackcurrant flavors that are generously oaked. Amazingly, the wine is still young and tannic. So beautifully structured, so smooth and polished, firm yet soft, just a gorgeous wine. Hold onto it until at least 2012, if you can."
23304,Cabernet Sauvignon,Diamond Creek 2002 Volcanic Hill Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,175,95,2002,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/diamond-creek-2002-volcanic-hill-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"Starts off as a closed, tight wine, aromatically speaking, and needs plenty of decanting to breathe, but once it starts to open, there's an eruption of the most refined cassis and cedar aromas. In the mouth, this is an immense Cabernet, profoundly deep in blackberry, roasted coffee and dark chocolate flavors. It is also enormously tannic, and is effectively locked down. Nowhere near ready, although decanting will help it, but it's best to hold this magnificent wine until 2007, when it should start to open, and then for at least 10 additional years."

It's a huge mouthful of cherry pie and cassis flavor, with the most delicate notes of raspberries, toasted meringue and vanilla, subtlely spiced and dry. A gorgeous Pinot Noir that superbly combines power with elegance."

The aromas of cassis, red currants, cedar, tobacco and cigar box lead to massively packed Cabernet flavors wrapped in huge, dusty tannins. The wine is so balanced, so distinguished and complete. Decant now if you must drink it, but it should start to mellow by 2008, and then peak and hold through 2015 at least."

It feels full and complete, despite the elegantly light silkiness in the mouth, and the crisp acids and dusty tannins that frame cherry, cola, rhubarb, pomegranate, coffee and vanilla spice flavors. Enjoyable now, this wine thankfully strikes a different direction from today's heavy, overly ripe Pinots. Drink now through 2012."

Year after year, Margaux makes great wine simply because of its vineyard. This year, with the high proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon, the wine has stunning, ripe tannins and very pure black currant flavors, but also a denseness from the ripeness of the fruit. It's a classic already, and is sure to age beautifully."

It is dense, very ripe (from the high percentage of Merlot in the blend), but still packed with tannins. It's a massive wine, bringing together the heat of 2003 with the big tannins of Saint-Estèphe. Imported by Diageo Chateau &amp; Estates."

Has it retained that status? It is certainly a hugely powerful wine, monumental even. It is also finely balanced, with great dark tannins working in partnership with brooding black fruit. The question is whether it is too big, too powerful: only time will tell. Imported by Diageo Chateau &amp; Estates."

Acidity and freshness come to finish, giving the wine a delicious lift. Imported by Diageo Chateau &amp; Estates."

Yes, it is more powerful than the usual aristocratic Lafites,  but it still manages to retain a special air of great elegance and presence. The fruits are black, the tannins immensely powerful, the flavors are of black figs, dates, cocoa.

Cranberry, pomegranate and cherry meet rock, gravel and pepper. Lovely focus and purity; it's concentrated and tight, with a minerality that is compelling and distinctive. The best yet from Cailloux.

Modern, concentrated and packed with plump fruit, black pepper highlights, vanilla and chewy meatiness. One panelist likened it to Californian Syrah.

It's a huge, deep wine, brilliant in black currant, green olive and cocoa flavors, yet packed in big-time mountain tannins that pretty much shut it down on the finish. If you buy a case, begin popping corks in 2008. If you have a single bottle, it should be great in ten years, if cellared properly."

It has a youthful side in the still fresh cherry and raspberry fruit and vibrant acidity. But it's turning mellow, as the oak melts into the alcohol, lending a soft, creamy infusion of vanilla bean. It's so good now, it will be hard to keep your hands off it, but it should hold for another three to five years."

Sweet plum, blueberry and blackberry fruits are seamlessly married to layers of different flavored chocolates. Silky and supple, it uses oak as a sensual enhancement, but the wood flavors of mocha, nuts, butter and toast are so beautifully smoothed into the fruit that they are never intrusive."

This is an enormously attractive, well-oaked wine constituted from the best possible fruit. In the mouth, it immediately seduces. Shafer knows it has to rise to expectations with this wine, and the 2001 does not disappoint. The fruit is spectacular, all cassis. The oak is rich, flamboyant and delicious. Structurally, the wine has the best tannin-acid structure Napa is capable of. Immediately delicious now, this wine should develop over the next 10 years."

The differences are minute. Colline is perhaps a shade more acidic, a bit leaner, a little drier and more tannic. But like Galets, it is an authentically great, young Pinot Noir, as elegant and complex as any Pinot of the vintage."

It's very dry, with a full, firm texture of tannins and acidity, but most notable are the flavors. They are extraordinarily rich, mingling red and black cherries, mocha, cola and spice with toast, caramel and smoke from fine oak. Despite the wine's density, it possesses lightness and elegance that make it uplifting. Drink now and over the next several years."

It is high in acidity and extremely dry. The flavors and mouthfeel are so complex that it takes several sips to grasp what's going on, by which time the wine has climbed to even higher levels. This is truly great California Pinot Noir."

If you're laying down '02s to cellar, this is a very good bet. It's shut down right now, but offers tantalizing hints of black currants and cassis that quickly disappear into a dry, tannic underworld. But the wine has the balance and authoritative class to age well beyond 2010."

Opaque in color, with monster aromatics that run from tar and espresso to maple, violets, cumin and finely scented candle wax. Deep and intense as they come, with charcoal and menthol notes on top of primary blackberry and cassis. No other word besides ""massive"" describes it. Hugely tannic and weighing in at 17%; needs five to seven years minimum in the cellar."

It's a huge, masculine wine, authoritative and ageable. Pours dark and drinks tannic and oaky, with a massive core of cassis, cherry and chocolate fruit encased in perfect tannins. What grace and power, what balance. Drink now through 2016, at least."

The palate is like a nova; it bursts with plum, blackberry and cinnamon. No harshness, not too tannic, and splendid on the finish, where toast and chocolate appear and stick around for a long time. It's 80% old-vines Garnacha and 20% Cabernet, and there just aren't enough superlatives to describe it. Only 300 cases made. Imported by Rare Wine Company."

And as rough as that may sound aromatically, on the palate it's polished like a gemstone, with just enough grit and guts to push it forward.

Not as immediately lush and flamboyant, it's a trace more reserved. Darker, too, more tannic and closed. Starts with an earthiness. Airing brings out cherries and cassis. There is great balance and integrity here, even though it is in desperate need of cellaring. Drink 2009."

The '01 version of Termanthia is outrageously powerful and deep, like a shot to the jaw from Lennox Lewis in his prime. It's maxed out in terms of leather, smoky oak, and depth of fruit. Almost hard to describe, it's so big and mauling. Hold until at least 2008. 330 cases made."

How good it is, is shown in the 2001 wine, which is generous, almost opulent, rich and dense. Despite the richness, though, this is still Bordeaux: Dry tannins, tarry black-fruit flavors and firmness place the wine definitely at the table."

Flavors of plum, cherry and vanilla are otherworldly, and there's enough tobacco to conjure memories of a fine cigar. A Tempranillo-Cabernet-Merlot blend worthy of its reputation."

He is right: With its denseness, spice, flavors of black currants layered with dryness and fresh acidity, this is a huge and impressive wine that never forgets that it is Margaux. It is still young, and the dry tannic aftertaste, which lasts for many minutes, shows this."

They're fine and complex, but gritty. There's an astringency throughout that a great steak will cut through, but it would be infanticide to open this before, say, 2010.

The overall impression is of elegance, power and extreme balance. The tannins are soft enough for immediate drinking, yet should protect this wine through at least 2015."
35028,Tempranillo,Bodegas LAN 2001 Edición Limitada  (Rioja),Spain,38,95,2001,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bodegas-lan-2001-edicion-limitada-tempranillo-rioja/,"This is everything a modern-day super red is supposed to be. It's bold, smoky and masculine beyond reproach. The body is sturdy as a brick, yet it's cuddly and smooth. Flavorwise, you won't believe the cascade of cassis, black cherry, vanilla and licorice that flows from the palate. And the finish lasts an eternity. Hold until 2006-07, and then let it rip."

Somehow manages to combine monstrous power with understated elegance. The strength is obviously in the ripe fruit and elaborate oak, while the subtlety lies in the soft tannins and impeccable balance. It's a wine you return to over and over, trying to figure it out, but it's always a step ahead. Drink now, with rich fare, or age through 2020."

Deep, dark and complex, it offers dramatic helpings of plum sauce, leather, blackberry, chocolate, coffee and oak flavors that don't stop. The tannic structure is a wonder. Completely dry, yet with a fruity sweetness, it's totally drinkable now and for the next few years."

Citrus peel, plum, wild berry, red currant and spice are set upon a base of rich mineral and rock, with precisely cut tannins. Hold 8–10 years."

It starts with wonderfully rich and inviting aromas of Provencal herbs, such as thyme, bay leaf and rosemary, and a note of lavender. The fruit is all cherries and blackberries, sweet and pure, seasoned with smoky oak. Fresh in acids, backed with firm but soft and complex tannins, this is a dramatic and beautiful wine. What a long, rich finish."

Pure Cabernet Sauvignon, this bursts with ripe fruit, with new wood flavors and with great intensity from the low-yielding old vines. This promises great things, but it also needs patience - wait at least 10 years."
37687,Red Blend,Beresan 2002 Stone River Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),US,28,95,2002,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/beresan-2002-stone-river-red-wine-columbia-valley-walla-walla-wa/,"Sophisticated winemaking meets gorgeous fruit in this unusual blend: 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Syrah, 20% Merlot and 20% Cab Franc. The Syrah's fresh citrus flavors are perfect in the context of the sappy Merlot and harder Cabs, making a wonderful blend that is immediately accessible with sweet, round fruit; then  lingers into a long, textured, lively finish."

The winemaker says the Syrah brings complexity and backbone, although I don't know that the Cabernet needs much help. But this is an extraordinary wine. It's richly sumptuous in chocolaty, black currant fruit, and soft as velvet, but without being cloying, due to the sweet tannins and bracing structure."
37690,Cabernet Sauvignon,Harlan Estate 2000 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,300,98,2000,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/harlan-estate-2000-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"A stupendous wine that epitomizes the Harlan style of grace and power. Shows how the most elaborate vineyard and winery practices can contribute to a near-perfect wine, even in a less heralded vintage. The flavors cascade in endless tiers, black currant, cherry, mocha, Indian pudding, oak and spice, all coming together in a minute-long finish. Magnificent."

Aged nearly two years in all-new French oak, this massive wine stuns with its superb balance. Manages the elusive challenge of reining in hugely ripe black currant, cherry and oak flavors and sweet tannins while keeping the palate impression soft and alluring, almost feminine. Just gorgeous right out of the bottle, but should develop effortlessly through the decade and beyond."

It's sweet in black currant, plum, mocha and oak flavors, yet retains a balanced dryness. A stiff backbone of acidity provides life and zest, but the intricate tapestry of tannins has a soft, aged feel. Voluptuous in the mouth; will age and likely improve beyond 2010."

Hard to exaggerate the beauty of the currant and cherry fruit, so ripe, polished and pure, and the sweet finesse of the tannins. In a few years the inherent structure will kick in, tightening the wine and guaranteeing it a long life."
39087,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hewitt 2001 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),US,75,95,2001,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/hewitt-2001-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-rutherford/,"An inaugural release from Chalone Wine Group, and an important one. Possesses the hallmarks of greatness, from the subtle but complex mingling of cassis, cherry, herb, tobacco, mint and dark chocolate flavors to the fabulously ripe, sweet tannins. Big and sturdy yet nuanced, this wine is gorgeous now and should last  many years in the cellar."

Dramatically concentrated, everything's on steroids, but controlled and beautiful. Very ripe and plush, oaky and young, fabulously expressive. Flavors are of black currants, sweet cherries, vanilla, smoke. A perfect expression of youthful brilliance and ageworthiness."
39353,Pinot Noir,Louis Jadot 2002 Chambertin Clos de Bèze  (Gevrey-Chambertin),France,140,97,2002,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/louis-jadot-2002-chambertin-clos-beze-pinot-noir-gevrey-chambertin/,"This is one of the great Burgundies of 2002. It shows the power of the year, with huge black fruits and dense tannins. But it also shows the charm, with ripeness that promises a precocious development as well as long aging."
39447,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Roda 2000 Roda I  (Rioja),Spain,60,95,2000,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bodegas-roda-2000-i-tempranillo-blend-rioja/,"It's hard to imagine the subsequent vintage surpassing this purring monster, but it could and probably will. That said, the current 2000 is magnificent in its dark masculinity and layered complexity. The fruit aromas are perfect, the spice notes exotic, and overall it's just a blast to drink. Lots of sweet oak is still front and center, so give it until 2006 for it to show even better."
39448,Pinot Noir,Louis Jadot 2002 Charmes-Chambertin  (Gevrey-Chambertin),France,100,95,2002,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/louis-jadot-2002-charmes-chambertin-pinot-noir-gevrey-chambertin/,"A big, powerful, smoky wine that exudes great jammy fruits, flavored with dark cherries. It is solid as well, promising years of development with intense tannins and a streak of acidity."

It's extremely aromatic, rich and textured, tight and dense. As it slowly opens it reveal layer upon layer of black fruits, mineral, salt and lovely, evanescent hints of herb. It does not show its 14.9% alcohol except for a slight bit of heat in the finish. Very, very young; Quilceda Creek Cabs may be the longest lived in Washington."

It is still just feeling its way at this stage, a wine that can last 15–20 years at least."
39452,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Roda 2001 Cirsion  (Rioja),Spain,200,97,2001,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bodegas-roda-2001-cirsion-tempranillo-blend-rioja/,"Dark as night, pure as silk, and rich as a sultan. This one wine defines the best of the new wave; a great high-end product from a perfect vintage. It's intense, spicy, racy and still soft enough to wrap yourself around. Licorice, crushed peppercorn, chocolate, espresso and blackberry are just some of what you can pull from this baby. Cellar a few years then explore."

The wine is dense, the low acidity almost irrelevant in the huge tannins, the super-ripe fruit intoxicating."

It's very classy and already into its development. The fruit is pure and dark, and the finish is what some might call “monster,” which is a good thing. A winner with all the right stuff. Hold three to four years before drinking."
40939,Sangiovese,Fuligni 1999  Brunello di Montalcino,Italy,82,95,1999,Tuscany,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/fuligni-1999-sangiovese-brunello-montalcino/,"Anyone who loves great Sangiovese should snap up this star-quality wine. Always a personal favorite, the '99 doesn't disappoint. It's lively and electric, with structure equal to the Tuscan fort in which it was tasted. As for flavors, look for overflowing blackberry, cola, mocha and more. A wine that can probably last for 15 years."

However, if you like texture, sublime flavors of chocolate and charcoal, and perfectly integrated oak, this is for you. Consider drinking in 2005 or 2006."
40942,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Pétrus 2003 Barrel Sample  (Pomerol),France,NULL,96,2003,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-petrus-2003-barrel-sample-red-pomerol/,"95-97 One of the great successes of 2003, and a surprise given the problems with Merlot in Pomerol. This is a powerfully huge wine, but its fruit is so rich, so superb that the tannins have just become part of a complete whole."

The tannins are certainly solid and serious, but then they are also sweet, dusty ripe, sustaining dense dark plum flavors and only a hint of wood."

The aromas practically defy description, packed with smoke, tobacco, cigar box and cured meat, all wrapped around a deep, rich core of black cherries. Picks up even more complexity in the mouth, adding vanilla, plums and dates in an expansive, mouthfilling experience, then—wham—the tannins hit home, sending you reeling and wondering when this wine will finally blossom. Great now, great 20 years from now."
41890,Red Blend,Vall Llach 2000 Celler Red (Priorat),Spain,88,95,2000,Catalonia,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/vall-llach-2000-celler-red-priorat/,"This one is up there with the very best of the region. It's downright purple, with a powerful, classy, dense nose that exudes pine, lemon peel and loads of blackberry and plum. The flavor profile is a splendid mix of boysenberry, cherry, fennel and black pepper. And the finish is driving and spicy, a wonderful blend of cola, chocolate and berries. A dazzling wine."

Smooth, rich, ripe and loaded with complex flavors. Black cherry, blackberry, plum, cloves, coffee, spice, chocolate, licorice, anise, menthol and eucalyptus all weave a kaleidoscope of taste for a tantalizing, heady and satisfying wine. Velvety tannins frame it all, leaving it long and lush at the end. Just when you think it's over, a new wave of plum, chocolate, toast and vanilla teases the palate for an even longer finish."
44408,Syrah,Beckmen 2001 Purisima Mountain Vineyard Clone #1 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),US,40,95,2001,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/beckmen-2001-purisima-mountain-vineyard-clone-1-shiraz-syrah-syrah-central-coast-santa-ynez-valley/,"The best Syrah of the vintage, a magnificent wine that blows you away through the force of its beauty and sheer voluptuousness. Pours dark and thick, and announces itself with muted but distinguished aromas of cassis, cherry pie, truffle, vanilla and smoke. Only in the mouth can you begin to appreciate the fantastic wealth of flavors. All this richness is reined in by dusty, structured but easy tannins and the oak regimen. For all its size, the wine maintains delicacy and femininity. With only 125 cases produced, it's hard to find, but worth the search."
44520,Cabernet Sauvignon,Liparita 1999 Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,50,95,1999,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/liparita-1999-vineyard-reserve-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"In a word, massive, a masterpiece of Napa Cabernet from a great vintage. A barrel selection from three vineyards, and a mere 275 cases produced. This wine pours dark and thick, and announces itself with smoky oak aromas riding over cassis. The flavors are rich in blackberries and herbs, framed in rich, thick, dusty tannins. As good as it is, it would be a shame to drink it now. Best after 2004, and for many years afterward."
44521,Cabernet Blend,Robert Young 1999 Scion Red (Alexander Valley),US,50,96,1999,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/robert-young-1999-scion-red-sonoma-alexander-valley/,"So good, it makes you want to shout. Possesses the beautifully ripe flavors that are expected of a great vintage, such as blackcurrant, cherry, white chocolate and cassis, with extra edges of smoky caramel and vanilla. The tannins are perfect, soft and easy, but as rich and complex as a Renoir. Differentiates itself from Napa with its softness and accessibility, but as great as anything from across the Mayacamas."

Right now, it's the biggest but not the best of the 2000s, showing dark earth and rich black cherries, along with notes of each, kirsch and a hint of alcoholic warmth. Turns increasingly floral and rose-like with air."
45314,Pinot Noir,Domaine Romanée Conti 2000 Richebourg  (Burgundy),France,375,95,2000,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-romanee-conti-2000-richebourg-pinot-noir-burgundy/,"Exquisitely perfumed. The wine starts off with cherry and spice, including a strong cinnamon component.

Bold, sleek and velvety on the palate, with a distinct core that is pleasingly redolent of fresh-picked grape stems, but surrounded by ripe raspberry and cherry flavors. It evens out with hints of leather, toast, crème brûlée, rose petals, citrus and toast on the long, lingering finish."

Its blackberry core is juicy without being overblown; black olives, earth, leather and even a little raspberry flesh out the flavor profile. Has a velourlike texture in the mouth; its tannins are soft enough to age well,  but age it certainly needs—it's showing restraint, and will need about 10 years to reach full bloom. Cellar Selection."

Fragrant, with plenty of plum, black cherry, cedar and spice aromas. On the palate, it's silky smooth, elegant and fresh, yet packed with complex layers of blackberry, cassis, chocolate, coffee, anise, sage, thyme and cherry flavors. Marked by an exquisite textural elegance and harmonious balance, it displays a fine blend of firm, supple tannins and appropriate acidty that support great length on the finish."

The texture is solid, filled with firm tannins, the flavors are black and ripe. Along with the power, though, is much of the elegance and poise that characterizes great Saint-Julien."

With its sweet fruit, opulent but balanced wood and red and black fruit flavors, it is a wine that will develop relatively quickly but will certainly age."

The perfumes, delicate and sensuous, give it class, style and make it very memorable. It is delicious now, but there are tannins there, and deep, intense fruit flavors, waiting to develop slowly and surely."

It has hugely rich fruit, it is has great density. But what will give it its longevity is the layer of tannin that sits, brooding, in the middle of the wine. Don't even attempt to drink before 2012."

Every characteristic suggests power, from the dark color, through the knock-out perfumes, full of dark, brooding fruits. The flavors are black, intense and ripe. It is a delicious wine, surprisingly ready to drink. And yes, just at the end, there is a small hint of the delicacy and elegance that is true Haut-Brion."

With its power and structure it will age over 20 years or more. Backed by blackcurrant and jelly flavors, it shows great fruity attractiveness even at this early stage in its development. It will develop slowly and evenly to become a reference point for the vintage."

And a star it remains. There is big, ripe fruit, with solid, ageworthy tannins. It may not be as powerful as some of the blockbusters of the vintage, but it is certainly more opulent, less classical than Léoville-Barton can sometimes be."
47621,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Mouton Rothschild 2000  Pauillac,France,450,97,2000,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-mouton-rothschild-2000-red-pauillac/,"With its distinctive antique bottle and gold etched label dominated by a sheep, this is definitely a move away from classic Bordeaux bottling. It is good that the wine can support the presentation. The fruit is so ripe, it almost tastes of raisins, but that sweetness is finely balanced by the dry tannins and concentrated texture. To finish, there are exotic spices, giving an almost oriental character to the long aftertaste."
47622,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Robert Young 1997 Scion Red (Alexander Valley),US,50,97,1997,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/robert-young-1997-scion-red-sonoma-alexander-valley/,"The second wine, and first red, from this famous vineyard-owning family, it's a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc. The wine is, in a word, classic. This great vintage provided super fruit, and the winemaking takes full advantage of it. This is very great Cabernet. It's so delicious you find yourself putting the glass down and thinking about it. A new First Growth enters the California pantheon."
47623,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château l'Eglise-Clinet 2000  Pomerol,France,108,97,2000,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-leglise-clinet-2000-red-pomerol/,"Denis Durantou's obsessive search for perfection paid off handsomely with this stunning 2000. Despite the richness of the fruit, there is still a sense of lightness to the wine which makes it surprisingly easy to comprehend at this stage. The Cabernet Franc perfumes couterpoint the rich Merlot, while the wood underpins everything."
47624,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Cheval Blanc 2000  Saint-Émilion,France,700,97,2000,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-cheval-blanc-2000-red-saint-emilion/,"In 2000, it seems the Cabernet Franc made Cheval Blanc. It has given a mysterious, wonderful perfume to the intense richness of the Merlot. It has less of the explosive power of Ausone, it is more subtle and elegant, reserving its explosion of richness for the end, when a welter of black fruits seems to go on for ever"
47625,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Pétrus 2000  Pomerol,France,1500,98,2000,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-petrus-2000-red-pomerol/,"While the first impression with Pétrus is the wood, it is the fruit which gradually shows itself. It is extraordinary, this dense fruit, which simultaneously manages to float with elegance. There is layer after layer of fruit, sometime black, sometimes smoky, sometimes spicy. The wine is not yet totally integrated, still intensely young, with decades to go. But what a development it will be"
47626,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Ausone 2000  Saint-Émilion,France,600,98,2000,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-ausone-2000-red-saint-emilion/,"Forget all those garage wines, forget the upstarts of Saint-Emilion. When you want real class, you have to turn to Ausone. What a wine - magnificently dense and opaque, hugely rich and sensual. Yet it doesn't seem in the least decadent - for deep inside the wine is a huge backbone of ripe tannins. Keep for at least 10 years"
47627,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Latour 2000  Pauillac,France,450,98,2000,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-latour-2000-red-pauillac/,"This is such an expressive wine, with elegance a major factor in its character. It is certainly huge, rich and dense. But there is much more to it. You can peel layers of fruit and tannins away, and still never get to the end of the wine's complexity. At every stage of its life, it will reveal a new character, but for now it is dominated by powerful tannins and huge, black, fruit."
47628,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Lafite Rothschild 2000  Pauillac,France,400,99,2000,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-lafite-rothschild-2000-red-pauillac/,"Perhaps of all the first growths in the totally un-classic 2000, this retains most of the classic Bordeaux. It is certainly almost black in color, while the new wood flavors are very present. But it shows an impressive restraint, leaving the power of the wine to be revealed over the years rather than immediately. This could well be the longest-lived of the Pauillac first growths."

Made from a small parcel of 80-plus-year-old Tempranillo vines, the resulting wine is packed with dense, smoky aromas wrapped around a core of brandied fruitcake. Huge, mouthfilling flavors of blackberries and roasted meat develop in the glass, all framed by wonderfully supple tannins. Cellar Selection."

Nonetheless, this is great Cabernet. Incredibly plush, ultrafeminine, with all the bells and whistles of a hallmark wine. Flavors lean toward cherry, blackberry, plum, strawberry, toast, vanilla, anise, herbs, spice and chocolate. It's all couched in velvety, smooth tannins and a finish that doesn't stop. Cellar Selection. —J.M."

You have David Abreu as your vineyard manager and Philippe Melka making the wine, from a vineyard less than 100 yards from Grace Family Vineyards. This Cabernet is jam-packed with dark fruit, chocolate and leather. There is great complexity and richness that carries through from start to finish. Cellar Selection. —C.S."

Unusually dark. Begins closed, but swirling brings out cassis and loads of smoky oak. Dense and lush, it's incredibly long on flavor, with fabulous intensity. The reputation of this collector's wine is undiminished. Cellar Selection. —S.H."

Intensely beautiful aromas of black currants, rich, thick and fine tannins, and soft acids are framed in beautiful oak. Soft and gentle in the mouth, but with an authority that affirms itself on the long, fine finish. Spectacular. —S.H."
50307,Cabernet Franc,Pride Mountain 2000 Cabernet Franc (Sonoma County),US,52,95,2000,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/pride-mountain-2000-cabernet-franc-sonoma-county/,"It's easy to make Cab Franc tasty almost anywhere, but difficult to make it great. Pride succeeds in the latter with mountain grapes that concentrate flavors. Lush, opulent blackberry fruit is exquisitely offset with rich oak and dusty tannins. The texture is fabulous, at once light and dense."
50308,Syrah,Carlisle 2000 Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),US,46,95,2000,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/carlisle-2000-syrah-dry-creek-valley-23864/,"Brutally good—in fact, fabulous—Syrah. Has the class, depth and richness of the best Northern Rhônes. The density of texture is like molten lead, with a quicksilvery mouthfeel that spreads delicious fruit across the palate. Yet despite all this power, the wine feels light and feathery. It combines elegance with mass in an extraordinary way."
50399,Cabernet Sauvignon,Silverado 1999 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),US,65,95,1999,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/silverado-1999-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-stags-leap-district/,"No way you can drink just one glass of this magnificent, rich, even decadent wine. It can't be beat for the sheer sumptuousness of its rich cassis flavors and soft intricate tannins. Absolutely delicious now in its youth, yet complex and ageworthy."

Aged in small French and large Slavonian oak barrels, the wine is full of aromas of violets and old-fashioned roses. The palate is deliciously open, with ripe fruits, flavors of dark cherries and plums. A dry, tannic layer gives it structure, the acidity gives it freshness."
50401,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hundred Acre 2000 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,100,95,2000,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/hundred-acre-2000-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"Redolent of rose petals and black cherry in the nose, it fans out into a silky-smooth texture that supports elegant  black currant, blackberry, plum, anise and spice flavors with just a hint of chocolate and herbs. A lengthy finish leaves a velvety impression on the palate. This is an auspicious debut made exclusively from the owner's estate vineyard. Barrel samples from 2001 show it's no flash in the pan. The next Napa cult Cab?"
50402,Pinot Noir,Joseph Drouhin 2000 Le Musigny  (Musigny),France,139,95,2000,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/joseph-drouhin-2000-le-musigny-pinot-noir-musigny/,"Enticing ripe fruits envelop this wine in a rich cloak of red fruit, chocolate and spices. The tannins are deceptively easy, but provide considerable power underneath the elegant fruit. At this stage, the wine is still very young, but there are plenty for indications of a rich, long-term future."
50403,Pinot Noir,Domaine Georges Roumier 2000  Bonnes-Mares,France,120,95,2000,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-georges-roumier-2000-pinot-noir-bonnes-mares/,"From its dense color and its thick aromas of smoked meats and hedgerow fruits to its dense, rich and concentrated fruit, this is a superlative wine. The solid fruit and hugely extracted tannins give it great weight. This could age for at least 20 years, and certainly won't be ready to drink before 10."
50404,Nebbiolo,Poderi Aldo Conterno 1998 Cicala  (Barolo),Italy,112,95,1998,Piedmont,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/poderi-aldo-conterno-1998-cicala-nebbiolo-barolo/,"The Conterno wines have long set the standard for more traditional Barolo. With its brown-red color and its aromas of ripe strawberries and dark plums, this wine combines powerful dried fruits with modern tannins and great concentration. It is an enormous wine that will age well over 15 years or more."
50405,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lail 1999 J. Daniel Cuvee Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,80,95,1999,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/lail-1999-j-daniel-cuvee-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"High-end stuff, the cutting edge of what Napa is doing with Cab. The fruit is exquisitely ripe, the quintessence of black currants, but this density is balanced by lightness and grace. The mouthfeel is round and soft. Luxurious tannins will protect the wine as it ages."
50406,Red Blend,Carlisle 2000 Two Acres Red (Russian River Valley),US,36,96,2000,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/carlisle-2000-two-acres-red-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"An amazing wine, made from old vines near Olivet Lane. The grapes were mistaken for Zinfandel for decades and sold as such, until recently identified as Petite Sirah, Valdepenas, Mourvèdre and Alicante Bouschet. This is as authentic a field blend as I have ever seen—and the best. Impossible to exaggerrate the purity, depth and concentration. Magnificent, lush texture, fabulous tannins, this wine is world class in every sense."
50407,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père &amp; Fils 2000  Bonnes-Mares,France,120,96,2000,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bouchard-pere-fils-2000-pinot-noir-bonnes-mares/,A deliciously concentrated and powerful wine from the domaine of négociant Bouchard Père et Fils. Rich chocolate aromas and intense concentrated black fruits give a strong sense of power and richness. The fruit is rich enough to dominate the tannins. This should age magnificently—10 years at least.
50408,Pinot Noir,Domaine Comte Georges de Voguë 2000  Bonnes-Mares,France,260,96,2000,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-comte-georges-vogue-2000-pinot-noir-bonnes-mares/,"Enormous fruit dominates this wine. Red fruits of every type, from raspberries to red currants mingle in a dense fruit salad. But underneath this mouthfilling fruit is a big, solid structure that promises great aging ability. Keep this wine for 10 years before opening, perhaps even keeping some more bottles for at least 20."

This single-vineyard Rocche is deep brick red in color. With its brooding black-fruit aromas and firm, dry tannins over immense fruit flavors, it is a huge wine, showing great potential. It should keep forever."
50410,Pinot Noir,Louis Jadot 1999  Bonnes-Mares,France,109,96,1999,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/louis-jadot-1999-pinot-noir-bonnes-mares/,"With the superlative 1999 vintage, Louis Jadot, one of the top Burgundy négociants, has been able to produce a deep, dense purple-colored wine. With firm tannins over huge black chocolate and sweet figs and huge layers of acidity, it has great shape and structure, worthy of the vintage. A big, chunky wine with enormous presence, rounded out by the wood."
50411,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Mondavi 1999 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,125,96,1999,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/robert-mondavi-1999-reserve-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"This flagship wine shows impeccable balance and finesse. It's well put together, as the couture people say, and drips with lavish, minty French oak. Soft tannins add interest as well as ageability. The wine is not lavishly fruity; instead, the flavors are consciously restrained and subtle. Very high quality, and worth holding through 2010."
50412,Pinot Noir,Domaine Comte Georges de Voguë 2000 Le Musigny  (Musigny),France,300,98,2000,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-comte-georges-vogue-2000-le-musigny-pinot-noir-musigny/,"This is great red Burgundy from the oldest domaine in the village. It is all there: powerful floral aromas, flavors of a coulis of black fruits, ripe tannins and sweet fruit with balancing acidity. The wine manages to combine a deep, almost brooding strength with a dense, silky texture. For a 2000, a lesser year than 1999, this is a great achievement. Keep for at least 12 years."
51303,Pinot Noir,Bergström 2000 Arcus Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),US,50,95,2000,Oregon,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bergstrom-2000-arcus-pinot-noir-willamette-valley/,"This sweet, extracted, creamy wine oozes lushness, ripeness and richness. The power is intense, the flavors dark plum, blackberry and cola. The tannins are big and plush, making for a huge, round finish. But be warned, one reviewer found it overly dry."

The perfume is extraordinarily detailed, suggesting black raspberry preserves, white chocolate, black pepper, tobacco, vanilla and smoke. All these flavors commingle in the mouth. Drinks dry, with dusty tannins. This is a brilliant wine, with a sensationally rich, vital finish. —S.H."

This Super-Tuscan blend of Sangiovese,  Merlot, and  Cabernet Sauvignon defines NapaÕs virtues: Complexity, deliciousness, and the softest, creamiest tannins, together with the modern penchant for low acidity and, of course, lots of new oak. This wine wows with opulence and impresses with elegance."
52304,Red Blend,Antinori 1999 Guado Al Tasso  (Bolgheri),Italy,80,95,1999,Tuscany,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/antinori-1999-guado-al-tasso-red-bolgheri/,"Fast becoming one of the world's top luxury cuvées, this blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 10% Syrah is a complex amalgam of dry, classy fruit, herbal notes, smoked meat, black pepper and baking spices. Its calling card is its perfect body weight. It isn't heavy or jammy, but it manages to offer tons of stuffing and a graceful finish loaded with the essences of cola, coffee and chocolate. If possible, it should be cellared for several more years."
52305,Sangiovese,Talenti 1997  Brunello di Montalcino,Italy,NULL,95,1997,Tuscany,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/talenti-1997-sangiovese-brunello-montalcino/,"Riccardo Talenti, grandson of Pierluigi Talenti, the grand old man of Montalcino, currently makes one of the finest Brunellos with the help of consultant Carlo Ferrini. They are now using new wood for aging, and the extra layer of richness this brings is apparent in the comparative accessibility of this wine. Yet it is also huge, with classic tannins and intense, concentrated flavors of sweet blackberry jelly."

The fruit is complex and penetrating, focused and long, layered throughout a generous and extended finish. Cherries and chocolate linger on the palate, resonating long after the wine has been swallowed."

One whiff of the bouquet says it all: earth, currant, blackberry and coffee. The palate is equally sensational—a magic carpet ride of plum fruit, pure oak and solid but forgiving tannins. Drink and enjoy any time through 2006."
52308,Red Blend,Tenuta dell'Ornellaia 1999 Ornellaia  (Bolgheri),Italy,125,96,1999,Tuscany,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/tenuta-dellornellaia-1999-ornellaia-red-bolgheri/,"Spicy and full of cassis, tobacco and coffee aromas. Texture and mouthfeel are what this wine is all about; it is plush like velvet carpet. Deep, satisfying flavors of plum, black currant and vanilla lead into an ultrasmooth finish that is clean as a hospital emergency room."

Oozes with blackcurrant jam and cassis and a dash of black pepper. Flamboyant oak adds a perfume of vanilla and smoke. Fleshy, long and full, this beautiful wine is not a monster, but it coats the palate with spicy flavors that epitomize class and style."

Guigal 1999  Hermitage,France,55,95,1999,Rhône Valley,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/e-guigal-1999-red-hermitage/,"A massive wine, with its opaque, dense purple color, its huge tannins and its tight, powerful structure. When it develops—maybe in 10 or 15 years' time—the perfumed, juicy Syrah fruits that are just suggested for the moment are going to be as dominant as the tannins are now. What a wine it will be then."
53154,Rhône-style Red Blend,Éric &amp; Jöel Durand 1999 Empreintes  (Cornas),France,37,95,1999,Rhône Valley,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/eric-joel-durand-1999-empreintes-red-cornas/,"A huge, ink-black wine with all the brooding majesty that gives Cornas its reputation. A blockbuster with enormous rich, sweet tannins. At the end it is the quality of the superripe fruit from old vines that dominates, but it is certainly a wine to keep for generations."
53155,Rhône-style Red Blend,Domaine Jean-Michel Gerin 1999 La Landonne  (Côte Rôtie),France,150,95,1999,Rhône Valley,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-jean-michel-gerin-1999-landonne-red-cote-rotie/,"Here is a superbly rich and smooth wine.

This is the wine for those who want power with big tannins, and they don't come more powerful or tannic than this. Its aging potential is enormous:  after 10 years there should be more sign of the perfumed fruit which is there, somewhere."

This is a tight, focused effort, with powerful black fruits augmented with herbs and spices and a hint of mineral. Young, tart and tannic, it will continue to improve as it knits together over the years. Editors' Choice."

As an expression of pure Syrah, there are few better."
53159,Red Blend,Dalla Valle 1999 Maya Red (Napa Valley),US,120,96,1999,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/dalla-valle-1999-maya-red-napa-valley/,"Plush, smooth and packed tight with complex flavors. Blackberry, anise, black cherry, tar, coal, spice, earth and herbs remain tightly wound, waiting patiently to reveal their full charm in time. Supple, smooth tannins and beautiful balance give this wine classic elegance."

Packed with cassis, sage, plum, tobacco, earth and smoky oak, and perfectly dry and balanced. Sheer joy in the mouth, like liquid velvet. It changes every second, offering up tiers of flavors through the spicy finish."

It is a wine for power. Dry fruits and tanninc aromas give an immediate sense of structure and strength. On the palate, it is wild, savage almost, with huge tannins and untamed exotic perfumes. The wood—42 months in new wood—seems almost incidental to the power of the fruit. The aging potential is obviously enormous."
53163,Rhône-style Red Blend,J.L. Chave 1999  Hermitage,France,125,97,1999,Rhône Valley,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/jl-chave-1999-red-hermitage/,"Jean-Louis, the son of Gérard Chave, is now in charge of the family business, as well as being president of the Hermitage wine producers. He is continuing the family tradition of making powerful statements of Syrah from Hermitage, combining massive structure and over-powering perfumes. This 1999 seems to have the best of the traditional world of tannic immensity and the modern world of beautiful, ripe fruit. A wine that will age for a very long time."

Chapoutier 1999 Le Méal Ermitage  (Hermitage),France,150,98,1999,Rhône Valley,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/m-chapoutier-1999-le-meal-ermitage-red-hermitage/,"Chapoutier's selections of the best parcels of vines in Hermitage are set to become legendary. Sold under the ancient spelling of the appellation name (Ermitage), they represent the epitome of the power and concentration that lies behind the reputation of the appellation. This cuvée is the best of the collection, with its brooding, opaque character, suggesting rather than revealing power at this stage. Age it until your new-born baby is old enough to drink, and it will be just about ready."

This is a meaty, oaky Cab, with firm, tongue-lashing tannins, plenty of red berry/cassis fruit and a power-packed profile from top to bottom.

Ripe, classy cassis fruit is seamlessly married to layers of oak; the barrel aging adding dimensions of toast and chocolate, espresso and cream, butterscotch and roasted nuts, to the extended finish. The blend is three quarters Cabernet, with the rest a 50/50 split of Merlot and Petit Verdot. In my experience Leonetti's reserve wines are magnificent upon release, and should be enjoyed while still young. Just 576 cases produced."

Yet it holds on to the subtle notes as well. An open palate with sweet-tart fruit and vanilla notes. The rich, round feel, the depth of fruit, and the velvety tannins nearly veil the solid structure.

A similar power infects the palate, where red and black cherry meet with plum, mulberry, cola, shaved chocolate and a deepening sage character, finishing on crushed mint."
90361,Pinot Noir,Chanson Père et Fils 2013  Charmes-Chambertin,France,330,95,2013,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chanson-pere-et-fils-2013-charmes-chambertin/,"Powerful and structured, this wine is dark with black fruits.

This is an incredible wine, as always, but particularly soft and structured in this fine vintage, which deftly marries pretty aromatics and zippy acidity with darker, stormier elements of ripe fig and wood smoke. There's so much complexity and life going on, it'll be hard to wait on this one, though more time in the bottle should make everything that much more settled and complete. Drink now through 2023."

Firm and tannic, almost totally from Mourvèdre, this dark and brooding wine is nowhere near ready to drink. The organically grown grapes give a purity of fruit that cuts through the tannins. Don't drink before 2018."

Rose petals ride a voluptuous texture and concentrated notes of chocolate, caramel and black cherry; it's as savory as it is buoyant and floral. Still holding on to a wealth of tannin and body, it will cellar well despite being delicious and enjoyable today."

On the palate, it's all about the New World, a hit of power and concentration that takes on weight and length without ever becoming heavy, the acidity firmly in sync with the fruit."

Floral and as tempting as blueberry pie, this concoction from Jesse Katz is velvety smooth and silky on the palate. White chocolate dances around its edges, along with a strong suggestion of cigar, which may perhaps come from the fine lady on the label."

Bright strawberry, sweet rose, leather, star anise, cardamom, black-cherry-laced gingerbread and vanilla show on the rich and full nose. The tannins part to open dried strawberry, plum, rose hip and earthy flavors, proving both manly in presence but feminine in delicacy."

Juicy, expansive and effusive, this wine is made from 100% estate-grown dry-farmed, relatively old vines of the variety, and introduces itself as a Cab-lover's version, with explosions of black pepper and plum that soften to a polished point on the finish. Mouth-filling, it wraps in complex notions of cedar, cigar and dark chocolate. Drink some now and some later; cellar through 2023."

The acidity is slowly simmering on the palate, unleashing flavors of dark chocolate, cinnamon, more rosemary, blackberry and pencil-lead minerality."

But if you had to pick just one, it would have to be this massive, beautifully structured bottle from Les Collines vineyard. Concentrated boysenberry fruit leads into a firm, sleek, subtle wine with even deeper flavors of black cherry, chocolate, espresso and baking spices."

It retains the natural fruitiness of the vintage as well as a more defined texture. Concentration and densely ripe fruit are already finely integrated with the hints of wood. The wine speaks of long aging potential; don't drink before 2019."

This is powerful but focused from front to back, with hard but honest tannins that will soften with time. Pure, potent flavors of cherry, berry and chocolate come with tons of spicy, peppery oak and all sorts of textural depth. Drink from 2015–2028."

It's loaded with alluring blue flower, creamy wild cherry and black raspberry sensations accented by notes of carob, clove and white pepper.

It's made only in selected years (the last vintage was 2000) from Ferreira's Quinta da Leda in the Douro Superior. This new vintage is superb. It's a richly tarry wine laden with dark plum fruits and tannins that are just beginning to mature. It's a ripe and luscious, demanding attention, yet will still age for many years. Drink now, or hold until 2020."

A rich mix of Asian spices coat a sensuous wine with a rich core of ripe black cherry fruit. Seams of cola and sassafras run through the palate, and on into a lengthy and utterly delicious finish.

The flavors of blackberries, black currants, chocolate, licorice and smoky cedar are absolutely delicious. Yet the wine possesses structure, not the easiest thing to achieve with a 100% Cabernet this rich. The wine should age well through 2020, but there's no reason not to drink it now."
131045,Cabernet Sauvignon,Betz Family 2011 Père de Famille Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),US,68,95,2011,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/betz-family-2011-pere-famille-cabernet-sauvignon-columbia-valley-wa/,"Intriguing scents focus upon chamomile and Mediterranean herbs, while the fruit flavors are wild and brambly.

The complex aromatics shoot up a smorgasbord of cured meat, truffle and umami notes, leading into a crisp, racy palate with lovely blueberry-dominated fruit flavors. Aging in 500-liter puncheons smoothes it out while contributing just a hint of new toast."
131047,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Januik 2011 Reserve Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),US,65,95,2011,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/januik-2011-reserve-red-columbia-valley-wa/,"Januik's reserve blend is 84% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Franc. It's built like the Fortress of Solitude—at first impenetrable, then slowly revealing layer upon layer of deep, dark black fruits. A base of iron and stone adds further gravitas."
131050,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mark Ryan 2011 Lonely Heart Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),US,85,96,2011,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/mark-ryan-2011-lonely-heart-cabernet-sauvignon-columbia-valley-red-mountain/,"This bottling is quintessential Red Mountain in style, with potent aromatics of concentrated black fruits, gun metal and rock. Sourced from Ciel du Cheval, Obelisco, Force Majeure and Klipsun, it's a one-wine showcase for the AVA. The spectrum of fruit flavors is impressive, compact and deep, and despite the high alcohol it retains its precision and detail."
131051,Cabernet Sauvignon,Betz Family 2010 Père de Famille Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),US,68,97,2010,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/betz-family-2010-pere-famille-cabernet-sauvignon-columbia-valley-wa/,"As good as any Père de Famille to date, this brilliantly crafted wine jumps from the glass immediately with a rainbow of blue, purple and black fruits. The scents and flavors are dense and seamless, the tannins polished and graceful, and the barrel aging puts the last dabs of paint on a winemaking masterpiece."

Along with rich flavors of black raspberry fruit, it's dense with savory herbs and marvelous details of earth and forest floor. Delicious now, but just wait until 2020–2022!"
131036,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Oakville East 2010 Core Stone Red (Oakville),US,125,95,2010,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/oakville-east-2010-core-stone-red-napa-oakville/,"Based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, this shows hard tannins and dryness despite the intensely ripe blackberries and cherries at its core. Two-thirds new French oak is not too much, adding balancing toast and wood tannins. This gorgeous wine will begin to come into its own by 2018, and should evolve for many more years."
131037,Cabernet Sauvignon,Coomber Family Ranch 2010 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),US,126,95,2010,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/coomber-family-ranch-2010-private-reserve-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-rutherford/,"There's good structure to this Cabernet, thanks to the firm tannins and ample acidity. But the flavors take the starring role, with raspberries, cherries, currants, mocha and cedar. It has a light, delicate mouthfeel, although there's nothing light about the taste. It's complex and ageable, so give it until 2020 to begin to come around."
131039,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Cadence 2010 Cara Mia Vineyard Bel Canto Red (Red Mountain),US,60,95,2010,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/cadence-2010-cara-mia-vineyard-bel-canto-red-columbia-valley-red-mountain/,"The best Cara Mia yet, this is Red Mountain Cabernet Franc from the estate vineyard, with 15% Merlot and 8% Petit Verdot included. Stylish and compact, this seems sculpted with pure, vivid purple fruits, balanced against crisp, fine-grained tannins. The depth and concentration are noteworthy."

The flavors of black currants and minerals are intense and fine, complexed with new French oak. However, the strong tannins will jacket the wine for a long time before they begin to fall out. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2024, and it could be awesome in 2030."
131043,Tinta de Toro,Teso La Monja 2011 Alabaster  (Toro),Spain,220,95,2011,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/teso-monja-2011-alabaster-tempranillo-tinta-de-toro-toro/,"Smoky berry, lemon peel, graphite and huge black-fruit aromas provide a stellar opening. Raw tannins and staunchness create a powerful palate that needs time to mellow out. Flavors of loud oak, black fruits, hard spices, toast and licorice finish peppery, tough and with some heat. Best from 2015–2023."
132343,Pinot Noir,Brick House 2011 Evelyn's Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),US,60,95,2011,Oregon,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/brick-house-2011-evelyns-pinot-noir-willamette-valley-ribbon-ridge/,"Honoring winemaker Doug Tunnell's mother Evelyn, this reserve bottling is a blend of barrels and clones, and yields the most concentrated of the Brick House 2011 Pinot Noirs. Cherry blossom scents give way to a solidly built wine with firm fruit flavors of plum and boysenberry preserves. A hint of pretty chocolate shines through the extended finish, bolstered with pitch-perfect tannins."

It opens with aromas of crushed blue flowers, black berries, pipe tobacco and thyme that give way to an elegant, structured and polished palate. It delivers intense blackberry flavors layered with white pepper, Mediterranean herbs, mineral and mocha brightened by fresh acidity alongside smooth, velvety tannins. This will age and develop for decades. Drink 2016–2040."

With dark tannins and impressive structure, it is big and fruity while never overwhelming. Dense black fruits, bitter cherries and dark chocolate combine with mineral, juicy acidity. It's a wine to age for many years, don't drink before 2018."

It is concentrated with huge tannins laced with black plum juice, dark berries and a dense, brooding character. A powerhouse of both fruit and tannin, it needs to age. Drink from 2018."
132425,Pinot Noir,Maison Roche de Bellene 2011  Clos de la Roche,France,295,95,2011,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/roche-bellene-2011-pinot-noir-clos-roche/,"Spice and mint dominate this intensely aromatic wine. Solid and very structured, it is still showing its wood aging and extraction. But its bright future is certain, with the weight of black fruits, the firm tannins and the mineral texture.

Classic Sonoma Coast Pinot, with brisk acidity and complex flavors, it shows wild raspberry, cherry and blueberry fruits, persimmons, cola, and earthier notes of sautéed wild mushrooms and truffles. It's dry, tannic and tart, but as good as it is now, it will improve by resting until 2020."
132427,Pinot Noir,Maison Roche de Bellene 2011  Chambertin,France,496,96,2011,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/roche-bellene-2011-pinot-noir-chambertin/,"This most powerful of Grand Cru vineyards has yielded another blockbuster. Even in the 2011 vintage, the wine is a massive statement, packed with rich fruits, dark tannins and layers of blackberry and juicy acidity.

Wood aging provides a judicious support to its fullness and opulence. Acidity, black cherries and red berry fruits come together with firm tannins.

It gives off waves of raspberry Newton cookie, fig, orange zest and vanilla bean, and the flavors are even richer. So much power in such a delicately structured wine, it's a real achievement. The garnet color is as translucent as glass, the acidity is perfect and the alcohol gives the wine body and weight without being hot or heavy. As good as it is now, it will also cellar well; drink now–2018."

The tannins are hard and dramatic. As for the fruit, you can hardly find strong enough descriptors. It shows blackberry jam and black currants, cassis liqueur and minerals raised to fabulous mountain concentration. Violets and oak add to the equation. Somehow it all balances out, resulting in a wine of unusual grace and power. But it needs age. Drink 2019–2031, if not beyond."

The wine also stands out for the richness of the oak, so perfectly integrated, and the overall balance. Beautiful acidity and thick, rich, supple tannins come along with a gorgeous, long, dry finish. The vineyard is in Yountville. You'll want to cellar this 100% Cab until at least 2020, and it could be going strong longer."

The tannic structure is almost secondary in the welter of ripe fruits, but it is enough to promise aging. Acidity and rich fruitiness partner each other to give a wine that is both fresh and powerful. Drink from 2020."

A blend of fruit from Atlas Peak and Rutherford, the wine is a barrel selection from the winery's regular 2010 output, and accounts for only about 20% of total production. The Cabernet Sauvignon is mixed with a little Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. It's delicious in blackberry, cassis liqueur, dark chocolate and oak flavors, and well structured in acids and tannins. The wine should develop in the bottle for at least 10 years."

The fact that it's now more than five years old has helped to mellow it, but the tannins are still quite hard. The beautiful estate vineyard sits high in the Vaca Mountains, which helps to account for the wine's intensity and concentration. This is truly a world-class Cabernet that will age through at least 2032."

It is also subtle, not showing all its flavors at once, hiding beneath tannins and structure.

It is for the long haul, so don't drink before 2022, even better later."

The wine is exceptionally pure and delicious, rich in black currant, chocolate, black cherry and lots of toasty new French oak. The all-important tannins are exquisitely ripe and as fine as velvet. Nowhere near ready, this wine wants a good eight years in the cellar, and will gradually evolve through the mid-2020s, at the very least."

That combination of opposites gives it intellectual interest, a wine worth thinking and talking about. Technically, it's dry, fairly high in alcohol and oaky. The 100% Cabernet grapes off the estate are incredibly concentrated in black currants and cassis, showing their sunny, high elevation origins on Pritchard Hill. The wine is not perfect. There's a certain hollowness mid-palate, which has to be attributed to the challenging vintage. But it's a fabulous Cabernet to drink now, and it will reward cellaring for 10 years."

Although it's packed with rich black-currant and cassis-liqueur flavors that sink down in the midpalate and offer fruity satisfaction, the finish is firm and classic. The vineyard is on Atlas Peak, and the wine shows those mountain tannins but also fine minerality. Drink 2017–2025."

The delicious palate offers succulent blackberry, woodland berry and cinnamon-spice accompanied by big, brooding tannins. It's already stunning, but give this terroir-driven wine time to develop even more complexity. Drink 2015–2024."

Young, tight and peppery, it gains briary boysenberry flavors as it opens up, along with hints of soy and umami. A streak of maple syrup richness fills out the finish."

This remarkably intellectual, ageworthy wine is bone dry, with marked acidity and complexity. The flavors range from wild cherries, cola and balsam to raspberry tart and buttered cinnamon toast. Its complexity is like a mandala, increasing in beauty the longer one examines it. A softly tannic bitterness lingers on the finish; drink 2019–2030."

The vineyard is in the Pritchard Hill area, and the wine is 95% Cabernet with 5% Petit Verdot. It's a lush wine that's rich in black currant, cocoa and plum flavors, enhanced by smoky oak. The wine shows enormous complexity, with layers of minerals and dried herbs that are hard to describe. It has a long life ahead of it, so drink now–2022, at least."

This is a stunningly delicious wine, with ripe, powerful and concentrated black fruits. Baking spices, tar, pencil lead, even a whiff of compost all add to the complexity and the depth of flavor is magnificent. This can age at least a decade but is delicious already!"

The wine is rich but pristine with fruit, a testament to Phelps' superb viticultural practices and attention to detail at the sorting table. It's dry and crisp, yet rich and delicious, with flavors of strawberry and raspberry jam, rosehip tea and cedar. The tannins give the wine a velvety grip. As good as it is now, it would be a shame not to cellar it. Your window of drinkability begins in 2019 and extends for 15 years after."

It's lush with black currants, yet bracing in tannins, with a minerality that makes it feel firm and grounded. The barrels are 100% new French oak, lending a savory level of char and vanilla. This is clearly a wine to cellar for a long time. Start enjoying it in 2018, and it is likely to develop bottle complexity throughout the 2020s."

It's dry but sweet in fruit, and delicate yet potent at the same time. It's totally accessible now, but enormously complex. Flavors of raspberries and cherries meld with pomegranates and persimmons, as well as mushrooms, tea and licorice. It's a joy to drink now, and should develop in the cellar for at least 10 years."

Clove, baking spices and maple syrup flavors trump the ripe fruits that remain more in the background. Delicious now, or cellar for a few more years."

The vineyard is in the cool-climate appellation of Coombsville, which accounts for its superb structure of acids and tannins. Perfectly ripe black-currant flavors meld into toasty new-oak tones. At the age of more than six years, the wine is starting to mellow, but is only hinting at the drama to come. It has enough splendor to glidepath through the decades."

Think Hermitage with brighter fruit. It's intensely aromatic, dense and seamless, stacked with rich flavors of mixed berries, layers of smoke, earth and herb, and punctuated by citrusy acidity. Highlights of oranges and tangerines sneak into the finish, which lingers for an astonishingly long time. Exceptional in every way."

Both sites are high elevation, located only a few miles from the Pacific Ocean and extremely low in yields. Flowers negotiated a difficult vintage deftly with this low-alcohol wine of unusual delicacy and charm. It's complex and layered with cherry, raspberry, cola, wild thyme, balsam and sandalwood flavors. It's texture is like pure silk in the mouth. Drink now–2017."

It has weight and power, with rich black fruits balanced with fresh acidity. Touches of bitter extraction and wood aging are likely to integrate as the wine ages. It should develop into an impressive and powerful wine. Drink from 2018."

It's exquisitely crafted, a testament to both the vineyard and the winery's oenological talent. The palate is bright and tangy with acidity, and incredibly complex flavors of wild berries, mushrooms, balsam, cola and Asian spices. It's dramatic now, but will continue to improve for at least 15 years."

A blend of both new Dijon clones and older California selections of Pinot Noir, it is stunning with flavors of raspberries, cherries and Dr. Pepper. It's a balanced, elegant wine with vibrant texture , but needs time to truly shine. Hold till at least 2017."

It brims with luscious raspberries and cherries accented by brisk acidity and a hint of sweet, smoky oak. It's terrifically complex, with notes of mushroom, orange zest, cola, rosehip tea and persimmon. Dry and elegant, with a wonderful mouthfeel, it's gorgeous now, but will gain earthy complexity over the next 15 years."

Smooth and supple, it's a lush expression of purple and black fruits, generously endowed with darker flavors of smoke, tar, soy and licorice. There is a compelling, yet subtle, umami character overriding all else. It's drinking quite beautifully now, but could age considerably longer."

This bottling, which contains minor quantities of Petit Verdot and Merlot, spent 28 months in new French oak barrels. The fruit is incredibly ripe and intense, with flavors of black currants and chocolate-covered cherries. As hard as the tannins are, they must have been even more aggressive two or three years ago, so kudos to Trefethen for holding the bottle back for five years. This beauty is just now beginning its long journey. Drink now–2020."

The wine is so wonderfully full in the mouth and fabulously complex in flavor that it's hard to believe the alcohol is under 13%. With lovely, haunting flavors of raspberries, red currants, mushrooms, white pepper and sandalwood, it justifies the hype of the 2011 vintage. Will age well. Drink now–2021."

Cherry, cassis and earth aromas are spicy and mellow, not bullish or loud. This feels creamy but with enough textural grit to keep things lively, while flavors of vanilla, tobacco and plum are nicely integrated. A mild, medium-long finish epitomizes elegance. Drink now through 2025."

Although it will only improve with time, it's certainly enjoyable now for its raspberry, cherry, cola and oak flavors that will pair perfectly with a great steak.

Done in a Claret style, it's firm, lightly toasty, with explosive dark fruits, streaked with umami, saline sea scents, dried plum, fig, cassis, earth and herbs all entwined to create compelling aromatics that carry through to an impressive finish."
139589,Nebbiolo,Clendenen 2005 Bricco Buon Natale Nebbiolo (Santa Maria Valley),US,50,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/clendenen-2005-bricco-buon-natale-nebbiolo-central-coast-santa-maria-valley/,"Jim Clendenen is producing the greatest, most exciting Nebbiolos in California, and this wine, tasted at about eight years of age, is, in a word, fantastic. Major kudos to him for aging it this long before commercial release. Although there are still firm tannins, and Nebbiolo's acidity of course makes the wine highly strung to the point of tense, it is immensely drinkable now. You'll find waves of dried cherries, with hints of rose petal, tobacco, white pepper and exotic spices, especially cloves, wrapped into a texture as gently silky as a great Pinot Noir. Drink now–2020."

It's full bodied, with blackberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate and toasty oak flavors. The tannin-acid balance is as fine as Napa gets. Delicious now, but give it at least six years to achieve even more complexity."

Only 225 cases were produced, but it's worth a search if you're looking for classic mountain Cabernet capable of extended aging. The wine has a linearity that defines elegance, yet is rich in blackberries and cassis, with oak nuances. Containing small quantities of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot for complexity, it will reward aging until at least 2018, and should be going strong in 2030."

It's packed tight and almost impenetrable until it's had several hours of breathing time. A mouthful of black fruits is set amidst a sea of darker flavors: tar, smoke, charcoal, graphite, cacao, licorice and espresso grounds. Put this one aside for up to a decade."

The wine is dry, tart and moderate in alcohol, giving it the smooth silkiness you want in a fine Pinot. The flavors are something else, striking the perfect balance between ripe raspberries, earthy cola, red licorice and mushrooms, with all kinds of spicy complexities. The acid-tannin balance is impeccable. It's drinking beautifully now and should hold and change in the bottle over the next eight years."

The mouthfeel is soft and luxurious. This wine was bottled only in magnums, and it's gorgeous and delicious, with classic blackberry, cherry, currant and dark chocolate flavors. Despite its full body, the wine has an elegant silkiness that's light and feathery. This is clearly the greatest Cabernet Clos du Val has ever produced. Drink now–2026."

From opening scents of figs, berries and roasted coffee, on into a compact, potent midpalate that still seems quite young and fresh, this wine keeps adding layer upon layer as it breathes. Concentrated and perfectly balanced, it will age beautifully for another 15–20 years."

The oldest of the Cayuse vineyards, it's really coming into maturity, delivering a tour de force performance in this new vintage. Aromatically explosive, it opens with floral and citrus—notably orange peel—then fills out with a lush palate bursting with cherry fruit, and the winery's characteristic, savory, umami flavors. The finish seems unending."

It shows incredibly concentrated blackberry, dark chocolate and ripe cassis flavors, wrapped into impeccably rich tannins. Made from 100% Cabernet, it's a superb example of Hillside. Tasted from the same bottle a day later, the wine was even richer and more satisfying, which is a solid indicator of ageworthiness. Drink now–2028."

This 2010 is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, with almost the same percentages as the superb 2009 bottling. The wine is rich, dry and complex. It shows a fantastic array of blackberries, dates and dark chocolate, with fascinating notes of lavender and dill. The tannins are gorgeous, the acidity fine, and the application of oak is deft. It's hard to describe just how good this wine feels in the mouth. Drink now, after decanting, or within the next 20 years."

Smith's various Pinot Noirs. Gentle and yet complex, it opens with notes of raspberries and cherries accented with mushrooms and minerals. There's a deep, brooding earthiness, along with all sorts of spiced orange-rind and sandalwood notes. A great effort, and one of the best Pinots of the vintage. Drink now through 2020."

The combination of the two makes this as tough as any young Napa Valley Cabernet could be. However, the core is potent, suggesting intensely concentrated black currants and blackberries, reduced to their elemental essence. Do not touch this wine before 2020, and it should still be going strong in 2030."

The wine is extraordinarily delicate in the mouth, with a cloud-like airiness that's like pure silk. Yet there are powerful raspberry, cherry, herb, cassis, mushroom and sandalwood flavors that are a delight to experience. The wine has none of the unripe vegetal notes that mar so many other 2011 Pinot Noirs. Drink this gorgeous wine now and over the next 10 years."

The mouthfeel is light and silky, with refined tannins that give it a slight astringency. The flavors are vast and complex with raspberries, cherries and cola, but also forest notes of mushrooms, balsam and herbs. The acidity is fresh and appealing.

It's expensive, but worth the price. It dazzles for soft lusciousness, and the depth and complexity of blackberries, black currants, cassis and chocolate, as well as the perfect integration of new French oak. Yet the wine, which contains a splash of Malbec, is dry and balanced in acidity and velvety tannins. Great now, and will continue to please through 2022."

It is, in a word, gorgeous. Brisk in acidity, balanced in alcohol and oak, it displays a complex array of flavors, ranging from black cherries and cola to pomegranates, rhubarbs, persimmons and sweet currants.

Your first impression is of irrepressible power, with masses of fruit punching through an overlay of tannin and oak. Then the flavors fantail out, suggesting cherries, cola, currants and spices that are rich and complex through the long finish. For all its richness, the wine retains an agreeable delicacy of texture. Comprised of lots selected by winemaker Bob Cabral for this anniversary bottling, it's right up there with Williams Selyem's best 2010 Pinots, and just as ageable. Drink now–2022. The wine is only available as part of a two-pack from the winery for $250; the other bottle is the 2010 Morning Dew Ranch Pinot Noir, from Anderson Valley."

The wine is enormously fruity, with raspberry, cherry and red-plum flavors that flood the palate.

Perhaps the most notable feature is acidity; it's strong, almost tingly, and will certainly help the wine age. The flavors are explosive yet refined, with notes of cherries, cola, pomegranates and plums. Good as it is to drink now, you'll want to cellar it until 2018, and it will provide beauty for many additional years."

It's very tannic and closed, and locked down in astringency still.

The grapes are from a portion of the Wurtele Vineyard, which consistently produces spectacular Cabernets. The wine is rich enough to drink now for sheer power, but should easily hold in the bottle for years, gradually picking up bottle complexity. Only 106 cases were produced."
146350,Cabernet Sauvignon,Janzen 2010 Beckstoffer Missouri Hopper Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),US,100,95,2010,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/janzen-2010-beckstoffer-missouri-hopper-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-oakville/,"This is always one of Janzen's best bottlings, courtesy of one of the jewels in the Beckstoffer crown of vineyards. The 2010 is softly tannic and enormously rich, showing wave after wave of blackberry essence, cassis liqueur, dark chocolate and anise notes, with a firm minerality. It's beautiful now, but try to keep your hands off it until at least 2018."
146351,Pinot Noir,Lynmar 2011 Quail Hill Vineyard Summit Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),US,70,95,2011,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/lynmar-2011-quail-hill-vineyard-summit-pinot-noir-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"This is enormously rich, ripe and appealing, with waves of raspberry and cherry jam, cola, red licorice and smoky sandalwood flavors that are wrapped into gentle tannins. Comes from a block in the estate vineyard, and while it doesn't display dramatic differences from Lynmar's other blocks, it does highlight the structure and sheer opulence of all Quail Hill Pinot Noirs. Drink now–2019."
146354,Cabernet Sauvignon,JCB 2010 No. 10 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,200,95,2010,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/jcb-2010-no-10-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"The word massive barely begins to describe this Cabernet Sauvignon. It aims to compete with anything from Napa Valley, and does so largely successfully. The palate offers waves of ripe blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate and smoky oak flavors. What's harder to put into words is the elegance and balance. Despite its serious heft, the wine feels comfortable in the mouth. Indisputably an ager, it should begin to mellow after 2018, and continue to offer pleasure for many years."
146355,Red Blend,Matanzas Creek 2010 Journey Red (Sonoma County),US,100,95,2010,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/matanzas-creek-2010-journey-red-sonoma-county/,"Three things mark this Cab-based blend— intense tannins, fantasically concentrated fruit and a lively acidity that keeps the palate refreshed. It has a molten core of blackberries and cassis that is spectacular, yet nowhere near ready to drink. Needs serious time. Consider drinking from 2018, although it could be going strong for many additional years."
146356,Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon,Riglos 2010 Gran Corte Las Divas Vineyard Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon (Tupungato),Argentina,50,95,2010,Mendoza Province,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/riglos-2010-gran-corte-las-divas-vineyard-bordeaux-style-red-blend-malbec-cabernet-sauvignon-tupungato/,"A year after the 2009 version of Gran Corte was named WE's Wine of the Year, this is every bit as good, with more structure and tannins than the ultrarich '09. This 50-50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec is dense, with marzipan and blackberry aromas. It's just creamy enough on the palate, where intense blackberry, black currant, toast and spice flavors hold court. A firm, driven finish with buttery, toasted richness and dry spice flavors is sensational. Drink through 2018."
147438,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Von Strasser 2010 Reserve Red (Diamond Mountain District),US,135,95,2010,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/von-strasser-2010-reserve-red-napa-diamond-mountain-district/,"This is a 40-40 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, with the balance consisting of Merlot. It's a barrel selection of the winery's best lots, from its various vineyards, and has been aged in 100% new French oak. Yet it's not oaky at all, with the wood bringing only additional sweet, smoky richness to the red currants, cherries, dark chocolate and spices. This is a superb wine, delicious right out of the bottle, but it should develop and, depending on your tastes, improve over the next 20 years."
147508,Cabernet Sauvignon,Von Strasser 2010 Sori Bricco Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),US,80,95,2010,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/von-strasser-2010-sori-bricco-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-diamond-mountain-district/,"This is an enormous Cabernet, as packed with intensity and power as anything in Napa Valley. The vineyard is Von Strasser's highest on the mountain, which maximally exposes it to the sun, and you can taste the solar ripeness in the intense essence of black currants and dark chocolate. The tannins exhibit classic Diamond Mountain potency. This is a dense Cabernet that needs serious time in the cellar. Hold until 2019, and it will continue to develop for many years afterward."
147509,Cabernet Sauvignon,Von Strasser 2010 Estate Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),US,80,95,2010,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/von-strasser-2010-estate-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-diamond-mountain-district/,"While the winery's regular 2010 Diamond Mountain Cab is a barrel selection, this Estate Vineyard selection consists of “only the darkest, most extracted lots,” from the winery's various vineyards, according to the winemaker. That's exactly what you get, an inky wine, it's huge on the palate with blackberries, currants and dark chocolate, augmented by plenty of new French oak. It is absolutely delicious now, but the tannin structure guarantees to develop for 10–20 years."
147516,Pinot Noir,Failla 2011 Keefer Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),US,45,95,2011,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/failla-2011-keefer-ranch-pinot-noir-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"Lucky Failla gets to source grapes from this vineyard that most winemakers would trade their left arm for. It's lush, ripe and amazingly generous in raspberries and cherries, yet retains an elegant balance, as well as fine, mouthwatering acidity. Part of the attraction is low alcohol, which lets the stones and earthy complexities of the wine shine through. This is really a brilliant wine—light, delicate and powerful. If you want to age it for eight years or so, you won't be sorry."
147517,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gorman 2009 The Bully Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),US,45,95,2009,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/gorman-2009-bully-cabernet-sauvignon-columbia-valley-red-mountain/,"The 2009 Bully includes 10% Petit Verdot. It's seamless and complete, a firm, muscular, dark, smoky/earthy Cab with substantial tannins. The deeply powerful black fruits have a vivid presence and a slightly roasted character. This is a big bruiser, but beautifully proportioned."
147518,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem 2011 Terra de Promissio Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),US,55,96,2011,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/williams-selyem-2011-terra-promissio-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-coast/,"A new bottling from the winery. The vineyard is in the Petaluma Gap, a cool area south of the Russian River Valley, toward San Francisco. The vintage was cool, too, so the wine is brisk in acidity and low in alcohol, but it still tastes amazingly ripe and complex. The wine dazzles with waves of black raspberry jam, sweet olive tapenade, sautéed brown mushroom, root beer, moo-shu plum sauce and mocha. If those flavors sound like they don't go together, just try the wine. It's seamless and compelling. Drink now–2020."

Intensely aromatic, it explodes from the glass with baking spices and deep cassis fruit. Over the course of three days it opened into a sleek, stylish, complex mix of purple- and black-berries, dried herbs, bark, dusty cocoa and a streak of caramel. Long and lush, it's a wine to cellar for a decade or more."

It opens with a lovely floral aroma—a bouquet of clover and white flowers—then heads for the dark side, with black cherry and cassis. It's a big, tannic wine, beautifully crafted, and clearly differentiated from the winery's regular Cabernet bottling."
147512,Merlot,Nickel &amp; Nickel 2010 Harris Vineyard Merlot (Oakville),US,53,95,2010,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/nickel-nickel-2010-harris-vineyard-merlot-napa-oakville/,"This is a great Merlot that's intensely concentrated and dazzlingly rich—everything you want a Merlot to be. It's power packed with black cherries, cherry liqueur, cocoa and sweet oak, with firm, hard tannins. That is, of course, the Nickel &amp; Nickel style. It shows classic Oakville structure and a hard-to-define elegance, making it one of the best Merlots of the vintage."

A layered, tannic palate is next up, followed by complex flavors of toast, mocha, black fruit, licorice and pepper. Density and firm tannins drive the finish, which tastes like bitter chocolate and espresso. This powerful Toro will be at its best from 2015–2020."

Yet appealing as it is now, there are multiple subtleties waiting to be discovered, and the wine has a fine future. Like all of Marimar's Pinots, it's a big wine—rich and extracted and dense in weight. The flavors veer towards ripe pomegranates, black cherries and sweet licorice, with hints of dark chocolate, orange peel and even the umami of charcuterie. Despite the weight, it magically remains lithe, like a ballerina leaping into the air. Drink now–2019, as it gradually ages."
147515,Cabernet Sauvignon,Doubleback 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),US,89,95,2010,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/doubleback-2010-cabernet-sauvignon-columbia-valley-walla-walla-wa/,"This is a heavy-duty Cabernet, big in every way, with rich black cherry and cassis fruit, and dense, dark tannins. The long, slightly grainy finish reinforces the impression of raw power, yet the wine retains perfect proportion and is nicely differentiated from the other 2010s crafted by winemaker Chris Figgins."

It shows both the power and the structure of the vintage, as well as balances fresh, fragrant fruit. Dry tannins and the dusty texture are finely integrated into a wine that layers wood, intense acidity and great long-term potential."

Black Kite's River Turn, one of of its three annual block designates, is invigoratingly inviting, a heady mix of floral cherry pie, bright, full and ripe with a balanced backbone of acidity and a gentle hint of gingerbread. This wine is ready to enjoy this second, but if you can help yourself, it'll also hold up for several years in the cellar and no matter when you decide to drink it, pair exquisitely with a range of deftly mannered food."

So rich, so delicious, it's hard not to drink the whole bottle. Waves of raspberry and cherry preserves, date-nut bread, white pepper, brown sugar, vanilla and toast are wrapped in a silky texture, with gorgeous acidity and smooth tannins. Drink over the next six years."

Not drinking it immediately is difficult because of the delicious quality of fruit on display here and the lush, soft mouthfeel, but this should be at its best after 2018."

The aroma is profound with black currants, flavors deep and concentrated, and tannins as smooth and complex as Napa can produce.

Enormously rich and deep, with a fabulous compaction of black currant, dark chocolate, baking spice and cedar flavors. There's an interesting grilled meatiness, like the charred fat on a great steak, and lots of new oak, but it's perfectly integrated. The smoky, toasty barrel notes are perfect companions to the fruit's power. Drink this 100% Cab now and over the next 12–15 years."

It's vast in cherry, red currant and licorice flavors, plus multiple layers of sautéed mushroom, exotic baking spice, mineral and sweet, smoky sandalwood. It's also very tannic, with a brisk spine of acidity. Good as it is, it needs time for all the parts to knit together. Better after 2018."

With proper breathing time, it shows inviting notes of violets and strawberries, and it gains concentration through the midpalate, with additions of cherry and an almost liquid minerality. An almost delicate version of this wine."

It's a huge wine, powerful and concentrated in blackberries, black currants and sweet dark chocolate, with notes of spices on the long, dry finish. Drink it now, with the best beef entrée you can find. It should slowly develop bottle-age characteristics over the next 8–10 years, at a minimum."

Reminiscent in a way to high-altitude Argentine Malbec, this will cellar well for a decade or more."

The flavors immediately kick in with a solid wall of red cherries, licorice, persimmons, pomegranates and cola. An exciting, complex wine to drink now, and it should gather momentum over six years, maybe even longer."

Blended with a little Petit Verdot and Malbec, it slowly reveals massive layers of blackberries, cassis liqueur and dark chocolate, remaining stubbornly tight throughout. Many people will drink it soon with beef, and that's fine, especially with a good decant, but it should reward even more with 8–10 years in a proper cellar."
153162,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem 2010 Bucher Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),US,58,95,2010,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/williams-selyem-2010-bucher-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"For sheer voluptuous pleasure, this is one of Williams Sel-yem's best 2010s.

Made using fruit sourced from the winery's vineyard in the cooler southwestern part of the valley, near Sebastopol, this is rich in acids and soft tannins, but the flavors set it apart. Notes of raspberry, cherry, cola, tea, licorice, pepper and sandalwood abound and evolve with every sip. Drink now–2018."

The palate is tight, featuring layers of cassis, ink, anise, coffee and iodine, with an earthy salinity that runs through the finish.

Tremendous in flash and depth, it offers compelling flavors of raspberry and cherry, accented by sweet, smoky oak. There's such complexity in the acid and tannin structure, and in the earthy, stony, spicy nuances, that you find something new to love with every sip. This masterpiece is fabulous now, and will develop bottle complexity over the next 15 years, at least."

There's also something exotically briary and wild that intrigues. Even more remarkable is the texture, an amalgam of acids and tannins that rivals any Pinot Noir ever produced in California. It should age for up to 20 years."

But the En Chamberlin deserves first place again. Brilliant aromatics of smoked meat, bacon fat and otherworldly roasted accents seduce instantly. Once on the palate, the silky, balanced, near-perfect mix of umami and fruit, plus licorice, cassis, coffee liqueur and black tea notes suggest it's as decadent as it is delicious."

This shows the impeccable tannins and acids of Rochioli fruit, with sweet, ripe, deep flavors of cherry and spice. Notes of pomegranate, rum punch, dark chocolate and smoky sandalwood add complexity. Beautiful to drink now, it should continue to develop for at least 10 years."

It offers wave after wave of raspberry and cherry pie filling, rose tea, mineral and smoky sandalwood flavors, which are all wrapped into an incredibly fine texture of complex tannins and vibrant acids. The finish is dry and graceful. It's tough to keep your hands off of this wine, but it should hold in the bottle for 6–8 years, gradually losing fruit and gaining earthy, mushroomy complexities."

Give it at least eight years in the cellar."
154331,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Gruaud Larose 2010  Saint-Julien,France,NULL,95,2010,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-gruaud-larose-2010-red-saint-julien/,"For anybody looking for classic Bordeaux, this is the bottle to seek. “Classic” here means a wine with a tannic structure that also relies on a black currant flavor, with acidity providing freshness but not losing any concentration or aging potential. Keep for many years."
154471,Syrah,Zaca Mesa 2009 Black Bear Block Estate Grown and Bottled Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),US,60,96,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/zaca-mesa-2009-black-bear-block-estate-grown-bottled-shiraz-syrah-syrah-central-coast-santa-ynez-valley/,"If the first duty of a wine is to be delicious, this tiny production bottling succeeds beyond all measure. The Black Bear Block is almost always Zaca Mesa's best Syrah among its many releases, and so it is again in 2009. Take one sip and you're dazzled by the refined tannins, dryness and complexity of flavors: blackberry, cassis, plum sauce, mocha, bacon, smoky oak, white pepper, chamomile tea and licorice. What's harder to express is the sheer pleasure of the mouthfeel. This is an exciting Syrah, and may just be at the beginning of a long journey. Drink now and for many years as it slowly changes."
154472,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande 2010  Pauillac,France,NULL,96,2010,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-pichon-longueville-comtesse-lalande-2010-red-pauillac/,"With signs of new wood on the palate, this is a wine that maintains the polished feel of the wines from Pichon Lalande. It has a stronger presence of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend than in the past, making it more structured than its predecessors, with a dominance of black currant flavor. It shows the soft side of the vintage, but is also meant for aging."
154473,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Lynch-Bages 2010  Pauillac,France,NULL,96,2010,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-lynch-bages-2010-red-pauillac/,"This sumptuous wine is driven by perfectly ripe fruit as well as dense, dusty and dry tannins. Great swathes of blackberry sweep across the palate, followed by juicy acidity. Such a combination will make this impressive wine a delight to drink in 10 years and beyond."
154476,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt 2007 Plus Game Ranch Single Vineyard Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),US,150,96,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/goldschmidt-2007-plus-game-ranch-single-vineyard-selection-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-oakville/,"A dramatic Cabernet, complex and layered, this shows deeply concentrated blackberry essence, black currant, dark chocolate and raisin flaors that are intricately woven with a sweet, smoky oak influence. The tannic structure is thick and furry, but just about perfect. Should age for many years, gradually losing primary fruit, but it's drinkable now after decanting."
154478,Cabernet Sauvignon,Paul Hobbs 2009 Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),US,275,96,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/paul-hobbs-2009-beckstoffer-to-kalon-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-oakville/,"This is a pinnacle of the modern style of winemaking in Napa Valley. The tannins are strong but not aggressive. The acidity is just enough to provide balance for the tremendously rich blackberry, black currant, Kahlua and olive flavors. The oak is powerful, but the wine wears it easily. The finish is thoroughly dry, long and spicy. And although the alcohol is high, it's not impossible. You can drink it now, although the tannins could benefit from 6–8 years in the cellar."
154479,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Rauzan-Ségla 2010  Margaux,France,NULL,96,2010,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-rauzan-segla-2010-red-margaux/,"One of the top Margaux wines, this is in top form, finely balanced and as elegant as it is powerful. It is darkly structured, dense yet balancing tannins with ripe black plums. It expresses the complexity of the vintage. A wine for serious, long-term aging."
154480,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Pichon Longueville 2010  Pauillac,France,NULL,97,2010,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-pichon-longueville-2010-red-pauillac/,"This is quintessential Pauillac, a great wine with its Cabernet proudly at the fore. It ranks with the 2009 and, with its tannins, is sure to age longer than that vintage. Solidly structured, powerful and dense, with fruit promised for the future, it succeeds with its weight and great concentration."
154481,Syrah,Sanguis 2009 Six White Horses Syrah (California),US,75,97,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/sanguis-2009-six-white-horses-shiraz-syrah-syrah-other/,"Winemaker Matthias Pippig brings Syrah to a whole new level with this stunningly dramatic bottling. Don't worry about the California appellation, a peculiarity of the winery's ownership. It's made entirely from Santa Barbara grapes, namely from Watch Hill in Los Alamos and Bien Nacido in Santa Maria Valley. The intensity of fruit defies description. It suggests enormous blackberry and creamy-sweet chocolate, larded with bacon and sprinkled with black pepper—and that doesn't even begin to describe the toasty sweetness of the 100% new oak barrels. This is the best California Syrah of the vintage, and one of the greatest Syrahs the state has ever produced. This opulence comes at a cost, however: The alcohol is high."
154482,Pinot Noir,Failla 2010 Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),US,70,97,2010,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/failla-2010-hirsch-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-coast/,"This shows the trifecta of winemaker Ehren Jordan's deft hand, the fabulous Hirsch Vineyard and the wonderful 2010 vintage. Even if you knew nothing of the wine's pedigree, you'd be dazzled by its sheer richness of raspberry, cherry, cola and herb flavors, plus the firm, stone-driven minerality, the dryness, the feral mountain hints, the acidity and the overall dazzling structure. The alcohol level is comparatively restrained, providing just the right touch of warmth. New oak clocks in at only 30%, imbuing the wine with a nice seasoning of smoke. Definitely worth searching for, but only 375 cases were produced. Drink this wine now–2022."
154483,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Léoville Poyferré 2010  Saint-Julien,France,92,98,2010,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-leoville-poyferre-2010-red-saint-julien/,"A wine of architectural strength and classical proportions, this has straight lines that mark the packed, concentrated fruits, which are sustained by its tannins. This is certainly the best wine that Léoville-Poyferré has produced, sumptuous while so finely structured."
154484,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Léoville Barton 2010  Saint-Julien,France,150,100,2010,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-leoville-barton-2010-red-saint-julien/,"This is a magnificently solid wine, initially even a bit severe. At this young stage, the tannins dominate, but it's also full of black fruit notes. Very dense and concentrated, this is a wine that's even better than the legendary 2005. The structure tells of its extraordinary aging potential: don't even attempt to drink this for 10 years."
154456,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Cantenac Brown 2010  Margaux,France,NULL,95,2010,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-cantenac-brown-2010-red-margaux/,"One of the finest wines to come from Cantenac Brown for many years, this is powerful and dense, dominated by Cabernet Franc tannins and fruits. The structure has a smooth, polished character that locates it firmly in Margaux, giving elegance and discreet fruitiness. Age this fine wine for many years."
154457,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Branaire-Ducru 2010  Saint-Julien,France,NULL,95,2010,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-branaire-ducru-2010-red-saint-julien/,"This rich, full wine shows the chateau to be at the top of its form. It's finely balanced, pushing both its fruit and acidity, with the tannins taking the supporting role. With its power leashed, this shows the stylish side of Saint-Julien, although it will certainly age for many years."
154459,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Giscours 2010  Margaux,France,NULL,95,2010,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-giscours-2010-red-margaux/,"Giscours shows an initial character of great style and elegance. The shining fruit and concentrated tannins follow, making it both a seductive wine and one with a long-term future."

The blend of 65% Grenache, 20% Mourvèdre, 12% Syrah and 3% Cinsault starts off with lovely notes of wild thyme and dark fruit, then adds herbal complexity and chocolaty richness. It's full bodied yet firm, with some dusty but elegant tannins on the finish. It's excellent now, but will be even better in 2016 and beyond."
154462,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,La Mondotte 2009  Saint-Émilion,France,NULL,95,2009,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/mondotte-2009-red-saint-emilion/,"Generous, rich and ripe, this boasts black fruits and sweet tannins. With layers of new wood, this is a wine that shows attractive fruitiness now and has considerable aging ability."
154463,Pinot Noir,La Follette 2010 Van der Kamp Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),US,40,95,2010,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/follette-2010-van-der-kamp-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-mountain/,"A tremendous wine, this appeals to the senses as well as the intellect. Dry, tart in acidity and somewhat tannic, it shows complex flavors of raspberry and cherry pie, bacon, cinnamon, white pepper and sandalwood. The finish goes on and on. So delicious now, you can hardly keep from drinking it, but this is a Pinot Noir that will age for 6–8 years, gradually losing primary fruit and gaining interesting mushroom and dried fruit notes."
154464,Mourvèdre,La Clarine Farm 2011 Cedarville Mourvèdre (Sierra Foothills),US,24,95,2011,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/clarine-farm-2011-cedarville-mourvedre-sierra-foothills/,"Light in color, alcohol and texture, this dynamic wine has a fresh pepper flavor, and is gorgeous all around, like drinking fresh rose petals. This could be enjoyed all day long, every day, but with only 51 cases produced, get it now or you'll miss out on it."
154465,Red Blend,Sanguis 2009 Gravity Red (Santa Barbara County),US,70,95,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/sanguis-2009-gravity-red-central-coast-santa-barbara-county/,"Sanguis combines its signature of exceptional power with finesse, producing a wine that is so dramatic as to defy belief. Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon provide the blackberry jam and chocolate richness, while Viognier brings a bright floral note, and even Roussanne has something to say by way of orange tartness. New oak is evident, but perfectly in balance with the wine's volume. Stunning and dramatic, but not an ager, so drink up."
155570,Syrah,Charles Smith 2009 Royal City Syrah (Washington),US,140,98,2009,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/charles-smith-2009-royal-city-shiraz-syrah-syrah-other/,"This beautifully reflects the vintage as well as the place. There is astonishing density, length and detail—as much as any Syrah in the country. The deep, compact and impossibly complex flavors mix notes of black fruit, cassis, licorice, coffee, baking spice, smoke and Bourbon barrel."
155943,Pinot Noir,Failla 2010 Occidental Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),US,60,97,2010,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/failla-2010-occidental-ridge-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-coast/,"This is an astonishingly good Pinot Noir that immediately shows the Sonoma Coast virtues of dryness, acidity, firm minerality, complexity and age worthiness. Flavors abound, with dominating notes of sour cherry, persimmon, cinnamon spice and sweet oak. It's rich and refined, pure, and a great expression of the cool 2010 vintage. Drink now–2020."
155923,Cabernet Sauvignon,Yates Family Vineyard 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),US,55,95,2008,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/yates-family-vineyard-2008-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-mount-veeder/,"This is an absolutely beautiful wine from a winery that's quietly been doing a great job with their Cabs. Made from grapes grown high up on Mount Veeder, which insiders know as one of Napa's premier mountain appellations, it's rich and softly refined in blackberry, blueberry, currant and chocolate flavors, with lovely minerality. It will age for a while, but there's no reason not to drink it now."
155925,Cabernet Sauvignon,Prime 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville),US,59,95,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/prime-2009-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-coombsville/,"A wonderful 100% Cabernet, this is Prime's first wine to bear the new Coombsville appellation. It's smooth, elegant and complex, with layers of blackberry and crème de cassis. It's beautiful now and over the next eight years."

Refined and elegant, it is precisely structured, with a firm herbal attack and a perfect blend of berry and cassis flavors. It's dense, deep and compact, suggesting long aging ahead."

Compelling structure, amazing purity and a well-modulated hint of chocolate from aging in 20% new French oak complete the picture."
155928,Cabernet Sauvignon,Amici 2009 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),US,125,95,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/amici-2009-morisoli-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-rutherford/,"Another successful Cabernet from Amici, who turns to this esteemed vineyard for sourcing. It shows real pedigree and finesse, and it's instantly appealing for its soft tannins and complex cherry, red currant, cocoa and spice flavors. Yes, it's expensive, but it's Amici's best Cabernet of the vintage, and this is as upscale as Napa Cabernet gets."
155929,Pinot Noir,Failla 2011 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),US,34,95,2011,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/failla-2011-pinot-noir-sonoma-coast/,"It's hard to believe that this fabulous Pinot is Failla's least expensive selection; what a great indication of his 2011s yet to come and of the vintage in general. It's bone dry and rich in raspberry flavor, with brisk acidity, firm minerality and a perfectly applied jacket of smoky oak. Elegant, pure and savory, it's just beautiful to drink now."
155930,Syrah,Failla 2010 Estate Syrah (Sonoma Coast),US,62,95,2010,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/failla-2010-estate-shiraz-syrah-syrah-sonoma-coast/,"Failla is so well known for Pinot Noir that we sometimes forget how good their estate Syrah can be. Given the vineyard's terroir, its red wines show better in cooler vintages—like 2010—while its above-the-fogline elevation encourages ripeness. This is dry, tannic and peppery, with a succulent blackberry flavor. Among the best Syrahs of the year, it's gorgeous now, and should develop over the next six years."
155931,Tinta de Toro,Maurodos 2008 San Román  (Toro),Spain,70,95,2008,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/maurodos-2008-san-roman-tempranillo-tinta-de-toro-toro/,"One of Spain's great full-force, modern-style wines, this excels despite the marginal 2008 vintage. It's open-knit and soft on the nose, with ladels of spice, graphite and black fruit aromas. It feels fresh, balanced and not overly tannic, with strapping blackberry, coffee, chocolate, spice and tobacco flavors all rolled into a fabulous whole. Licorice, espresso and amaro notes grace the padded finish. Drink now–2018."

It's so delicious that you'll want to drink the whole bottle. The inclusion of Cabernet Franc in the blend may be partly responsible for its accessibility. It's wonderful to drink now, despite having fine, firm tannins. Give it some decanting, and then watch as it changes in the glass with every sip."

It's flavorful and textural, with earth, anise and smoke notes, plus a mineral-driven wet-stone base and exceptional length."
155933,Cabernet Sauvignon,Moone-Tsai 2009 Cor Leonis Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,175,95,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/moone-tsai-2009-cor-leonis-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"This wine is entirely Cabernet, using grapes from the southerly Coombsville area and warmer St. Helena. As such, it's wonderfully balanced, with a sprightly burst of acidity brightening succulent flavors of black cherry and dark chocolate. The use of 100% new French oak sounds excessive on paper, but it's perfectly integrated, providing a jacket of sweet buttered toast that in no way overshadows the fruit. Enjoy it now and over the next 10 years as it ages."

Silky and seamless on entry, it pushes into a wine of power and punch. The fruit is complex and complicated, a mix of berry and cherry, with tart, tangy acid. While the wine is still primary, it has superb concentration and length, and it's beautifully structured for aging."
155935,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt 2008 Single Vineyard Selection Game Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),US,75,96,2008,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/goldschmidt-2008-single-vineyard-selection-game-ranch-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-oakville/,"This is rich and appealing, vast in flavor and luxurious in texture. It shows Oakville character in its smooth, velvety tannins and overall balance, with ripe blackberry, currant and dark chocolate flavors. If you can keep from drinking it now, it should hold in the cellar for 10–15 years."

Notes of blackberry, soft spice, chocolate, espresso and a touch of rosemary oil make for a beautiful bouquet. The mouthfeel is long, supple and rich. Drink after 2020."

It's made using grapes that are sourced from at least six vineyards scattered from Yountville to St. Helena. Right out of the bottle, it's a soft, smoothly tannic wine that's rich in blackberry jam, black currant, blueberry, raspberry, dark chocolate and spice flavors. The wine, which contains small amounts of Petit Verdot and Malbec, is so powerful, it easily carries the 100% new French oak. Just gorgeous now, and it should develop bottle complexity for at least the next 10 years."

Its flavors of wild raspberries and cherries, with spice and mineral overtones, are delicious. There's a feral quality that expresses umami perfectly, suggesting butter-sautéed, tamari-splashed mushrooms and crisped prosciutto. The oak is powerful and present in the form of toast and sweet vanilla, but perfectly balanced with the wine's volume. For all its richness, the wine finishes bone dry. Drink this impeccable Pinot Noir now through 2020."
157270,Pinot Noir,Flowers 2010 Camp Meeting Ridge Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),US,75,96,2010,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/flowers-2010-camp-meeting-ridge-estate-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-coast/,"This wine is an absolute joy to drink, and such a great expression of its Sonoma Coast vineyard. Its dryness, acidity and minerality highlight its terroir. Its texture is light and silky. Yet it's immensely complex in flavors, suggesting red cherry, licorice and exotic spices that are so rich, they're almost sweet in the finish. A tremendous Pinot Noir for drinking now, and it should develop in the bottle for a decade."
157272,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chimney Rock 2009 Tomahawk Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),US,135,96,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chimney-rock-2009-tomahawk-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-stags-leap-district/,"This is so charming now, it's hard to keep from drinking it. But it also has the dynamic tension to age well. Chimney Rock enters a whole new ballgame with its 2009 releases, which can stand against almost anything in Napa Valley. With a fleshy mouthfeel, softly sculpted tannins and complex flavors of blackberry, cassis, dark chocolate and plum sauce, this wine is decadently delicious. Drink now–2020."
157273,Cabernet Sauvignon,Knights Bridge 2009 Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,135,96,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/knights-bridge-2009-beckstoffer-to-kalon-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"Beckstoffer To Kalon Cabs aren't always fabulous, because so many wineries source its fruit, but Knights Bridge has a great track record. This release is their best ever. Dry and soft in the mouth, it's drinkable now, yet so firm are the tannins that it will easily age. As for the flavors, they're incredibly complex in blackberries, black currant and licorice. Best now and through the next 10 years."
157261,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Vesuvio 2009 Red (Douro),Portugal,73,95,2009,Douro,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/quinta-vesuvio-2009-red-douro/,"Capable of standing alongside the great Ports of Vesuvio, this table wine reveals the fantastic quality of its vineyard. It is both powerful and elegant, a wood-aged wine bearing a dense, dark flavor of black plum, with damson-tinged acidity. This impressive wine needs more than 5–6 years of aging."

In addition to the wealth of raspberry and red currant flavors and the wonderfully sweet new oak, it is extremely well balanced. The tannins are luxurious, the acid crisp and fine, the complexity a delight and the finish dry and long. This full-bodied selection offers refinement and intellectual appeal. Drink now–2016 for freshness."
157264,Pinot Noir,Evening Land 2010 Seven Springs Vineyard La Source Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),US,60,95,2010,Oregon,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/evening-land-2010-seven-springs-vineyard-source-pinot-noir-willamette-valley-eola-amity-hills/,"In a stellar lineup of 2010 Evening Land Pinots, this is the best. It displays eye-popping character and depth, a ripe powerhouse at just 13.1% alcohol. Black cherry fruit comes laced with cinnamon and baking spice notes. It's a full, round, rich, and fruity wine that just never quits."
158380,Cabernet Sauvignon,Summers 2009 Checkmate Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),US,140,95,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/summers-2009-checkmate-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-diamond-mountain-district/,"This is easily one of the most delicious Cabernets of the year. The first sip dazzles, offering a treasure chest of flavors, including blackberry, spice, mocha and toasted oak. For all the richness, the wine is properly dry, and the tannins are as smooth as old silk. It's so approachable, it's hard to believe it's from Diamond Mountain, whose tannins are notoriously hard in youth. The one drawback is that the wine is too soft for aging, but who cares? Drink now–2015."

Flavors of black stone fruits and red berries have the intensity of a powerful, age-worthy wine."

The big tannins are right upfront, lending a solid, dense texture. Gentle black fruits and acidity emerge on the finish."

It's the tension between the tannins and the ripe black fruits that give this wine its great aging ability and depth of flavor. It needs at least six years."
158381,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mark Ryan 2009 Lonely Heart Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),US,80,95,2009,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/mark-ryan-2009-lonely-heart-cabernet-sauvignon-columbia-valley-red-mountain/,"Pure, dense and deep, this captures the pure essence of Red Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon. Berry and cherry flavors surface in equal proportion, with more rock than barrel adding complexity throughout the finish. Excellent depth and structure suggest that this is one to put down for a decade or more."
158385,Corvina,Le Salette 2008 Pergole Vece  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),Italy,132,95,2008,Veneto,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/le-salette-2008-pergole-vece-red-amarone-della-valpolicella-classico/,"The fruit-driven- intensity and general youthfulness of this Amarone promise a very long future. It's well-built and bold, with a rich, chewy mouthfeel and lively aromas of leather, spice, plum, dark fruit and tobacco. It goes down beautifully, leaving a long endnote of divine chocolate fudge."

While it's structured, it will soften and round out over the next five years."

It would be a tragedy to open this 100% Cabernet before 2018, and even then it might be too early. Dry and full bodied, this offers complex blackberry and cassis flavors, with a grounding herbal quality suggestive of sage. The tannins are profound, making the wine tight now."
158498,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vine Cliff 2009 16 Rows Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),US,150,96,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/vine-cliff-2009-16-rows-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-oakville/,"As good as the winery's regular 2009 Cabernet is, this small-production selection from the estate vineyard is even better. However, as the tannins are fierce, it's not a wine you want to drink anytime soon. Through the astringency shines a bright, burning core of perfectly ripe blackberries and savory black currants. Flashy and impressive, this 100% Cabernet should begin to soften and mellow after 2018."
158499,Pinot Noir,Domaine Perrot-Minot 2010 Chambertin Clos de Bèze Grand Cru  (Chambertin Clos de Bèze),France,525,96,2010,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-perrot-minot-2010-chambertin-clos-beze-grand-cru-pinot-noir-chambertin-clos-beze/,"Despite its power, this is so elegant, showing tannins, minerality and generous flavors of black fruits, dark chocolate and spices. The smooth and rich surface belies the inner taut texture, showing how the wine will need many years to finally come round."
158500,Cabernet Sauvignon,Nickel &amp; Nickel 2009 Martin Stelling Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),US,155,96,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/nickel-nickel-2009-martin-stelling-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-oakville/,"Unbelievably rich and delicious, this is a joy to drink. It continues the winery's long record with this vineyard, reaching toward its apex with this 2009. Made from 100% Cabernet and aged in nearly two-thirds new French oak, it's elaborate, layered and complex, offering juicy notes of blackberry, black currant and dark chocolate, with sweet toast and vanilla flavors that continue onto the spicy finish. If you can keep your hands off it, this will develop over the next 10–15 years."

Rita Hills),US,85,96,2010,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/foxen-2010-sea-smoke-pinot-noir-central-coast-sta-rita-hills/,"This is the most expensive Pinot Noir Foxen has ever made, and guess what? It's also the winery's best. It bears rich flavors, offering tiers of smoky cherries, red currants, licorice candies, vanilla, sandalwood and spices. What's harder to describe is the sheer beauty of the texture and balance. Containing the explosive richness of a wine like this is a challenge, but winemaker Bill Wathan has managed to bring elegance to its power. The wine is high in alcohol, and it's not advisable to age it beyond 3 or 4 years, but it is incredibly delicious."
158487,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Lauren Ashton Cellars 2009 Cuvée Arlette Red (Red Mountain),US,50,95,2009,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/lauren-ashton-cellars-2009-cuvee-arlette-red-columbia-valley-red-mountain/,"This is a stunning Bordeaux-style blend of 57% Merlot, 19% Cabernet Franc and 9% Cabernet Sauvignon, with 2.5% each of Petit Verdot and Malbec. Tight, dark and dense, it showcases the detailed styling that epitomizes the Lauren Ashton portfolio. Perfectly ripe and perfectly proportioned, it has the power and tannin to age for decades."

Raspberries, cherries and rich chocolate run through this fine-tuned, focused wine. It's deep, elegant and penetrating, with a show-stopping layer of pure mineral that is so powerful the fruit seems soaked in rock."
158489,Cabernet Sauvignon,Abeja 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),US,44,95,2009,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/abeja-2009-cabernet-sauvignon-columbia-valley-wa/,"Good enough to be a reserve, this includes just 4% Merlot and the rest is all Cabernet. Smooth and supple, with lovely toasty aromatics, it layers rich cherry fruit against the lush barrel spices. A companionable wine, already drinking beautifully, but perfectly fine to cellar for up to a decade."
158490,Cabernet Sauvignon,Diamond Creek 2009 Red Rock Terrace Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),US,175,95,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/diamond-creek-2009-red-rock-terrace-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-diamond-mountain-district/,"The ripest of Diamond Creek's new '09 Cabernets, Red Rock shows a sun-blasted quality of red currants, blueberry and cassis. Heady and exotic, this is rich in tannins and noble in acidity. While it's a joy to drink now and over the next eight years, its extreme ripeness may limit its longterm ageability."
158492,Pinot Noir,Domaine Perrot-Minot 2010  Mazoyeres-Chambertin,France,475,95,2010,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-perrot-minot-2010-pinot-noir-mazoyeres-chambertin/,"The small Mazoyères-Chambertin Grand Cru creates structured wines with plenty of texture and tannins. This is brooding, firm and very concentrated, with its fruit set way behind the dark tannins and spice note. It will take at least 10 years to start to mature."
158493,Corvina,Masi 2003 Mazzano  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),Italy,175,96,2003,Veneto,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/masi-2003-mazzano-amarone-della-valpolicella-classico-156809/,"This has enormous richness and intensity, with penetrating aromas of leather, tobacco, spice, dark fruit and dark chocolate. On the palate, it's inky, rich and supersmooth. This is one of the best Italian wines ever made from the difficult 2003 vintage."
158494,Syrah,Corliss Estates 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),US,55,96,2007,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/corliss-estates-2007-shiraz-syrah-syrah-columbia-valley-wa/,"This winery gives its wines extra years in bottle prior to release, and it pays off with powerful, muscular, densely structured that have been polished to a fine luster. This Syrah emphasizes fruit, not funk, with opulent flavors of black fruit, dried cherry, fig and plum. The 30 months it spent in two-thirds new French oak adds dark streaks of coffee and cocoa. It shows tremendous depth, and it could be cellared for another few years—but why wait?"
158495,Cabernet Sauvignon,Diamond Creek 2009 Volcanic Hill Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),US,175,96,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/diamond-creek-2009-volcanic-hill-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-diamond-mountain-district/,"This shows the Diamond Creek signature of dryness, mountain tannins and voluptuously ripe, concentrated fruit. It's dense in blackberry jam and cassis flavors, with firm minerality and a lush toast note from the oak. Near perfection in all of its parts, it possesses those hard-to-define qualities of balance and elegance. Wonderful as it is now, the tannins suggest aging it for many years."
158497,Cabernet Sauvignon,Diamond Creek 2009 Gravelly Meadow Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),US,175,96,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/diamond-creek-2009-gravelly-meadow-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-diamond-mountain-district/,"Rich and powerful, with a molten intensity, this has loads of blackberry and cherry jam flavors, yet it has a minerally earthiness that grounds it and makes it endlessly complex. With its tannic profile and sweet oak jacket, this defines Napa Valley Cabernet—particularly from the mountains. If you can keep your hands off it, this will develop over the next 10–20 years."
158389,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kadiem 2009 Inaugural Vintage Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,85,95,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/kadiem-2009-inaugural-vintage-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"This is a really impressive launch for this new brand. Although the bottle doesn't bear a vineyard designation, it's 100% Cabernet from the Morisoli Vineyard in Rutherford, which has produced superb Cabernets in the past from the likes of Meander, Galleron, V. Sattui and Sequoia Grove. Dry and full bodied, it has flavors of sour cherry candy and cassis that often define Rutherford, which are all wrapped into smooth, supple tannins. Beautiful as it is now, it's a wine you want to lay down. Best after 2017."
158390,Corvina,Zenato 2006 Sergio Zenato Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),Italy,125,95,2006,Veneto,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/zenato-2006-sergio-riserva-red-amarone-della-valpolicella-classico/,"This is a real beauty, with huge intensity and loads of deep chocolate fudge, black cherry, cola, barbecue and black licorice flavors. It manages contrasting tones of sweet versus savory that pleasure the tastebuds. The palate is rich, smooth and superconcentrated."
158391,Corvina,Dal Forno Romano 2006  Amarone della Valpolicella,Italy,530,95,2006,Veneto,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/dal-forno-romano-2006-red-amarone-della-valpolicella/,"Dal Forno delivers one of the world's most impossibly rich and concentrated red wines. Using grapes sourced from the high-density Monte Lodoletta vineyard, this inky, dark expression oozes with syrupy tones of maraschino, dark chocolate fudge, cinnamon spice, crushed clove and barbecue smoke. In keeping with the wine's legendary reputation for long aging potential, the tannins are rock solid at the moment."
159893,Cabernet Sauvignon,Von Strasser 2009 Sori Bricco Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),US,80,95,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/von-strasser-2009-sori-bricco-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-diamond-mountain-district/,"This portion of the winery's vineyard always yields Cabernets of enormous concentration with hard tannins. The 2009 is a classic, detonating in the mouth with laserlike blackberry and cassis flavors, to which new oak brings additional richness of smoky cedar. It's really a beautiful wine, but very tannic, even by Von Strasser standards. Give it at least eight years, and it could be drinking well 20 years from now."
159753,Red Blend,Colgin 2008 IX Estate Red (Napa Valley),US,290,99,2008,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/colgin-2008-ix-estate-red-napa-valley/,"This is an absolutely beautiful wine to drink now, but the richness comes at the price of considerable alcohol. The color is dark and impenetrable, the aromas huge in Cabernet-inspired blackberries and black currants, with a touch of something herbal and also a stony minerality. There's also a fascinating peatiness, like an Islay Scotch. It really opens up in the glass, becoming ever more complex. It's great Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, but that high alcohol may limit its ageability."
159754,Malbec,Trapiche 2009 Finca Jorge Miralles Single Vineyard Malbec (La Consulta),Argentina,50,95,2009,Mendoza Province,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/trapiche-2009-finca-jorge-miralles-single-vineyard-malbec-consulta/,"This is a real blaster of a Malbec, showing power, concentration and subtleties. The bouquet is full of graham cracker, cola, monster berry and moss notes, while the pure, driving palate deals flavors of toasty blackberry, spice, mocha and more. The lengthy but mellow finish hums like a fine-tuned machine. Drink now–2018."
159755,Pinot Noir,Sanford 2009 La Rinconada Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),US,60,95,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/sanford-2009-rinconada-pinot-noir-central-coast-sta-rita-hills/,"There's a grace and purity to this Pinot Noir that make it particularly recommendable. It's so light and silky, it just glides like a butterfly across the palate. But it's extraordinarily rich in wild raspberry and cherry fruit, and the white pepper and baking spices make it savory. Delicious now, but it should prosper over the next eight years, at least."
159756,Cabernet Sauvignon,La Sirena 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,150,95,2008,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/sirena-2008-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"You will want to age this Cabernet—8 or 10 years of development is the only way to allow the hard tannins to begin to melt away, allowing the fabulous core of blackberries, currants and dark chocolate to emerge. It's hard to exaggerate the wine's depth; it's so elegantly pure, concentrated and focused. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2018, and it could still be providing pleasure 20 years from now."
159895,Pinot Noir,Furthermore 2009 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),US,50,95,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/furthermore-2009-gaps-crown-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-coast/,"Showing lovely silkiness, dryness and transparency, this is a Pinot to drink now or age for a while. The flavors are rich but elusive, suggesting wild summer raspberries, cola, pine needles and sautéed mushrooms splashed with balsamic, with the sweet smokiness of oak barrel aging. It's delicate and powerful, but only 47 cases were produced."
159896,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate 2008 Cristina Don Miguel Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),US,49,95,2008,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/marimar-estate-2008-cristina-don-miguel-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"The winery held this back an additional six months after their other 2008 Pinots were released, presumably to let it become integrated. Still, it's quite tannic, with a sandpaper-like toughness. Despite the astringency, the massive wild-cherry, cola, mushroom and anise flavors come through. It's a huge wine, feral and untamed—quite exquisite in its wildness. So delicious now, it's hard to resist, but the wise collector will cellar it for 4–5 years, maybe even longer."
159897,Merlot,Duckhorn 2009 Three Palms Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),US,85,95,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/duckhorn-2009-three-palms-vineyard-merlot-napa-valley/,"This is classic Three Palms Merlot—as excellent as anything Duckhorn has ever produced. It shows the hard tannins that always mark the winery's Bordeaux-style red wines, but it's luscious and deep in berry fruit, licorice, grilled meat and cola. It should have no difficulty negotiating the years. Give it until around 2015, but if you can't wait, at least decant it for a few hours."
159898,Pinot Noir,Walt 2010 The Corners Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),US,60,95,2010,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/walt-2010-corners-pinot-noir-mendocino-lake-counties-anderson-valley/,"This is a big Pinot Noir, with an explosive intensity of cherries and raspberries that is ripe and pure. Oak, of course, is there too, in the form of buttered, smoky toast. However, the wine isn't a mere fruit bomb. It has interesting nuances of earthy things, like mushrooms, nettles and Provençal herbs. The silky texture is an exquisite balance of acids and tannins. This new brand from Hall winery is made by their talented winemaker, Steve Leveque, and it immediately enters the California pantheon of excellent Pinot Noirs."
159899,Sagrantino,Arnaldo Caprai 2007 25 Anni  (Sagrantino di Montefalco),Italy,100,95,2007,Central Italy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/arnaldo-caprai-2007-25-anni-italian-red-sagrantino-sagrantino-montefalco/,"One of the top, if not the top, red wines from Umbria. The naturally tannic Sagrantino grape is softened by the careful oak aging that adds layers of chocolate and spice to the grape's aromas of black cherry, tobacco and leather. This is bold, powerful, masculine and velvety on the finish. Pair it with stewed or grilled meat marinated in rosemary and garlic. Age this in a cellar for 10 years or longer."
159900,Cabernet Sauvignon,Duckhorn 2008 Patzimaro Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,95,96,2008,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/duckhorn-2008-patzimaro-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"Huge, rich and flamboyant, this hasa sweetness at its core—like the essence of red and black currants, with an elaborate note of caramel imparted from smoky oak. Yet everything about it is utterly and properly dry. The vineyard is in St. Helena, not quite in the Spring Mountain appellation, yet showing the fruit concentration firm tannins of mountain-grown grapes. Just a stupendous wine; try after 2016."
159901,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bryant Family 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,335,96,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bryant-family-2009-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"Rich and smooth in tannins, with some sharpness through the finish, this shows masses of ripe blackberries and dark chocolate. A bit of time in the glass reprises and accentuates the chocolaty richness. Despite its power, this is refined and high toned, a serious cellar candidate. Give it 10–15 years."
159902,Cabernet Sauvignon,Duckhorn 2008 Monitor Ledge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,95,96,2008,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/duckhorn-2008-monitor-ledge-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"This is an extraordinarily ripe, flashy Cabernet Sauvignon, one of Duckhorn's new red wines that is among the most impressive in years. The wine is densely packed in sweet red and black currant fruit, chocolate and licorice flavors, wrapped into firm tannins, with a bone-dry finish. Just fantastic to experience now, and it should easily develop over at least a decade."

From the first sip though the middle palate, it's seemingly sweet with a fruity essence, but the finish is dry and firm. Drink now and for 8–10 years, at the very least."
159904,Cabernet Sauvignon,Montagna 2009 La Presa One South Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,125,96,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/montagna-2009-presa-one-south-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"Absolutely delicious and a joy to drink, this tastes like fine blackberry preserves spread onto buttered whole-wheat toast, sprinkled with cinnamon and black pepper. Despite the rich sweetness, the finish is bone dry. But the tannins are considerable, giving the mouthfeel a furry astringency. This elegant, pure, young Cabernet should begin to open in 10 years."
159905,Cabernet Sauvignon,Piña 2009 Ames Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),US,85,96,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/pina-2009-ames-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-oakville/,"A vital, focused Cabernet, this shows the sheer classiness of Oakville in its concentrated blackberry and black currant fruit. It's seemingly sweet and dry at the same time, and the tannins, which are extraordinarily thick, are fine and pure. Irresistably delicious now, this changes in the glass by the second. It suggests it wants some time in the cellar, so drink now–2021."
159908,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gandona 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,190,97,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/gandona-2009-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"A dramatic wine, this is rich, full bodied and incredibly complex, laced with notes of ripe, sweet blackberries and crème de cassis, with a spirituous heat from relatively high alcohol. Its pedigree is clear throughout the entire tasting experience. This is a really gorgeous Cabernet, showing refinement and grace, but it is very tannic. Give it at least 10 years."
159909,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ovid 2009 Red (Napa Valley),US,195,97,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/ovid-2009-red-napa-valley/,"With a beautiful purple color, this wine quickly exhibits classic Cabernet aromas of black currants and cedar. In the mouth, it's full bodied and concentrated, showing powerful, sweet blackberry fruit. It's incredibly refined, impressively structured, massive, impeccable and frankly delicious. This should develop over the next 20 years, at least."

It's composed of the most intensly concentrated flavors of blueberries and blackberries—dense, pure and slightly heady with a liqueur-like alcohol. The tannins are classic Diamond Mountain, firm and minerally, while oak plays the perfect role of the buttered toast and sweetly charred supporting character. Despite its immediate attraction, it's best cellared for 6–8 years, at the very least. Fans of old Cabernets will still be loving it in 2029."
159894,Cabernet Sauvignon,Von Strasser 2009 Spaulding Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),US,80,95,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/von-strasser-2009-spaulding-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-diamond-mountain-district/,"This has so much rich earth and minerality, it's like a journey deep into a mine. It's noted the vines were planted in 1970, and the wine does have that old-vine concentration of fruit in the form of massively intense blackberries. Then there's the smoky new oak, which adds such a lusciously sweet jacket of buttered toast. Tannic and tight in the way of Diamond Mountain Cabernets, this should begin to come into its own after 2016."
160367,Cabernet Sauvignon,David Arthur 2009 Elevation 1147 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,150,99,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/david-arthur-2009-elevation-1147-estate-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"There are incredible aromatics on this Cabernet. It's powerful yet subtle (how can that be?), all about sweet, crushed summer blackberries and pure cassis liqueur. Elaborate oak, in the form of buttered toast, is perfectly in balance, never overshadowing the fruit. The tannins are dry, rich and smooth, defining Napa elegance, grace and beauty. World class, dramatic and just about perfect, this gets better and better as it breathes in the glass. Drink now–2030."

On the palate, it shows, power, smooth tannins and excellent length. Pair this with roast pork and baked prune."

This has fine grained tannins—not soft, but polished, ripe, and rich. Tasted prior to its official release, the wine was still pulling together all of the complex barrel-influenced flavors; it tasted delicious, with notes of bourbon-soaked cherries, along with veins of espresso, cacao, dusty baking spice, and a liquorous finish."
161184,Nebbiolo,Massolino 2001 Vigna Rionda Riserva Dieci Anni  (Barolo),Italy,250,95,2001,Piedmont,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/massolino-2001-vigna-rionda-riserva-dieci-anni-nebbiolo-barolo/,"An iconic wine from the 2001 vintage, this shows tertiary aromas of dried fruit, cassis, ginger, cola and licorice. But the wine really excels on the palate where it shows the magic intensity of aged Nebbiolo grapes with long, silky tannins."
161185,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Seven Hills 2009 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),US,38,95,2009,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/seven-hills-2009-ciel-cheval-vineyard-red-wine-columbia-valley-red-mountain/,"A top-notch vintage for this bottling, it's a blend of 39% Merlot (from the original 1976 block), 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Petit Verdot and 11% Cabernet Franc. Roses, blackberries, cassis and baking spices are beautifully rendered in a wine rich in depth and detail. More bottle age will surely bring greater complexity and soften the astringent tannins."
161186,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Pape Clément 2009  Pessac-Léognan,France,NULL,95,2009,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-pape-clement-2009-red-pessac-leognan/,"This is a richly structured wine with beautiful perfumes emanating from the bouquet. The rich, stalky texture is balanced by the flavors of dark chocolate and black currant jelly. It's big, ripe and full of potential, a fine balance between opulence and ageworthiness."
161187,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Haut-Bailly 2009  Pessac-Léognan,France,180,95,2009,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-haut-bailly-2009-red-pessac-leognan/,"Smooth and opulent, this immediately appeals with its generous fruit and texture that feels like velvet. The structure sits under the seductive surface, with a chocolate wood flavor, fruit tannins and density. Age for over 10 years at least."

This is gorgeous, showing power, intensity and complexity. Aromas include cassis, ginger, cola and crushed granite. It is finely textured and very long on the finish. Drink after 2018."

The plump, expressive midpalate opens generously and spreads fully across the tongue, offering notes of cherry, cassis, licorice and pepper."

It offers beautifully intense aromas of cassis, dried forest berry, ginger, cola, leather, and cedar. On the palate, it shows an incredibly silky and long quality. Hold for 10–20 years."

It's a fabulous wine, showing the winery's signature power, complexity and balance. The flavors are rich, with notes of red berries, persimmons, red currants, bacon and cola. Absolutely delicious now, and it should gain traction and change interestingly over 6–8 years."
161194,Merlot,Leonetti Cellar 2010 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),US,70,95,2010,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/leonetti-cellar-2010-merlot-columbia-valley-walla-walla-wa/,"A classic take on Merlot—this is 100% varietal, and was aged for 15 months in new and neutral French oak barrels and botti. The flavors move through strawberry, raspberry and Bing cherry, with great breadth of flavor and texture throughout. The midpalate is concentrated and full, with a fine, lingering, superclean finish."
161195,Nebbiolo,Gaja 2009 Costa Russi Nebbiolo (Langhe),Italy,495,95,2009,Piedmont,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/gaja-2009-costa-russi-nebbiolo-langhe/,"Costa Russi presents a dark wall of ripe fruit and an exotic spice shading that give momentum and power to the finish. There are also notes of plum, dark chocolate, tobacco, licorice and tar. The quality of the tannins is firm and polished; this should evolve over many years to come."
161196,Nebbiolo,Gaja 2008 Conteisa Nebbiolo (Langhe),Italy,240,95,2008,Piedmont,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/gaja-2008-conteisa-nebbiolo-langhe/,"A tiny percentage of Barbera grapes accounts for why this famous wine is not labeled as a Barolo. The Nebbiolo is sourced from the Cerequio Cru and offers long aromas of dried fruit, licorice, tar, tobacco, bitter chocolate and cola. The finish is extremely fine and polished. Drink after 2025."

Dense, textural and complex, it showcases exceptional blending of flavors from the addition of just 7% Merlot, 4% Carmenère and 1% Malbec. Notes of plum, cassis, coffee grounds, dark chocolate and a hint of herb run through a complete and engaging finish, retaining both elegance and power."

As it bursts with exotic barrel flavor, the fruit seems a bit buried, but time after time these wines unfold over the course of decades into glorious maturity. These are arguably the most long-lived and cellarworthy wines in Washington—if not in the entire country."
161211,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Figgins 2009 Estate Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),US,85,98,2009,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/figgins-2009-estate-red-columbia-valley-walla-walla-wa/,"The second release of Figgins—a single wine produced by Leonetti's Chris Figgins—is astonishing. Tasted in a lineup of exceptional Walla Walla reds, it outshined them all. It's a sophisticated blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Merlot, from the Figgins Vineyard, with gorgeous aromas of flowers, spices and black fruits. Seamless and long, complex and forceful without being overpowering, it can stand alongside top tier Bordeaux costing four or five times as much."

Bookwalter 2009 Conner Lee Vineyard Conflict Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),US,55,96,2009,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/j-bookwalter-2009-conner-lee-vineyard-conflict-red-columbia-valley-wa/,"The Conflict red is a mash-up of 38% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Franc, and it's a crowd-pleaser from the instant the cork is pulled. Dense scents of cherry, roasty-toasty barrel and cracker are inviting. The grapes were sourced entirely from the Conner Lee Vineyard. This effort showcases the winery's signature style, with notes of black fruits, exotic spices, coffee grounds and dark chocolate. Drink now or cellar for 6–8 years."

A masterpiece of blending, it has myriad pinpoint details, from the nose of flowers and berries, to the mouthfilling mélange of red and black fruits and finishing highlights of pepper and Asian spice.

Chewy, dusty, grainy, tannic and thoroughly delicious, it has the deeply flavored berry and cassis fruit to more than match the French oak. The fruit is wreathed in layers of smoke, charcoal and ash—all in proportion."
161177,Nebbiolo,Gaja 2008 Sperss Nebbiolo (Langhe),Italy,268,95,2008,Piedmont,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/gaja-2008-sperss-nebbiolo-langhe/,"Gaja's Sperss was once a Barolo but now occupies a category all its own as a Nebbiolo from the Langhe region—the producer famously declassified his top wines. This shows extreme elegance and sophistication with fine nuances of forest fruit, spice, dried tobacco, licorice and Spanish cedar. The finish is long, polished and bright. Drink after 2020."
161178,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Captûre 2009 Harmonie Red (Sonoma County),US,120,95,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/capture-2009-harmonie-red-sonoma-county/,"This Bordeaux blend is delicious, refined and ageworthy. It's dry and quite tannic now, but underneath the astringency is a beautifully balanced wine with intensely concentrated blackberry and dark chocolate fruit, with an earthiness. A terrific wine that should come into its own after 2017."

It's a brilliant wine, vastly deep, imposing and elegant, with a potent mountain flavor of black currant. The estate vineyard is very high in the Mayacamas Mountains, and you can sense the small size of the berries in the wines intensity, the sheer concentration, as well as the tannins—which are hard and tight. Clearly this is a wine that requires time in the cellar. Try in 2018, but it could worth aging well beyond that."
161197,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Domaine de Chevalier 2009  Pessac-Léognan,France,90,95,2009,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-chevalier-2009-red-pessac-leognan/,"Dominating aromas of smoky new wood follow through to the toasty flavor that covers the fruit at this stage. But, like all 2009s, this is a rich wine that will balance out and show all of its opulence. That said, it will likely always be a firm, ageworthy wine, with the dark tannins always in evidence."

Notes of cassis, fig and a hint of prune are swathed in deeper flavors of espresso and dark chocolate."

Pomegranate, blueberry, black cherry and cassis notes lead into a full-flavored wine that remains concise and perfectly defined. The blend is 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Franc. This is concentrated, with earthy depths suggesting Dr. Pepper, espresso and dark chocolate."

It's decadent and enormous in blackberries, cherries, currants, licorice, bacon and spice flavors, which are all melted into the perfect fusion of alcohol and warmth, and elaborated with smoky, toasty oak. With its level of elegance, this is wonderful now, and it should drink well over the next 15 years."

At first it's quite dense and unyielding, but it opens slowly over a period of days—not hours—remaining dense and compact, with a remarkable array of dark fruits and barrel flavors. As with its companion reds from Quilceda Creek, this is a wine to cellar for decades."
161204,Nebbiolo,Luciano Sandrone 2007 Cannubi Boschis  (Barolo),Italy,165,96,2007,Piedmont,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/luciano-sandrone-2007-cannubi-boschis-nebbiolo-barolo/,"You really can't beat the beauty of this Barolo. Rich, enduring and persistent, it offers a long array of blackberry, spice and cola-like aromas. The mouthfeel is spectacular thanks to a velvety texture that is backed by a pretty embroidery of cassis, licorice and spicy ginger flavors. Give this 10–15 more years of aging."

Some will find it too soft and fruity. Others will marvel at its sheer deliciousness. It's fantastically rich, a wine of deliriously decadent flavors, ranging from blackberry jam and crème de cassis to mocha, blueberry extract and buttered cinnamon toast. Yes, it's soft, but it's the softness of fine velvet. After all that richness, the finish is amazingly dry. Drink over the next few years to enjoy its youthful beauty."

This is so complete; it tastes like Cabernet on a cloud, light but ethereal, with ripe, polished blackberry and cherry flavors and touches of mocha, spice and cedar. The tannins are a wonder—soft and pliant—yet gorgeously complex. Drink now-2016, at least."
162586,Cabernet Sauvignon,Snowden 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,80,95,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/snowden-2009-reserve-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"This Cabernet takes its place among Napa's top tier.

With the weight of the middle palate and the long, spicy finish, it's especially attractive, although it's also quite tannic. The only difference between this Estate Monte Bello Cabernet and Ridge's Monte Bello Estate Cabernet ($150; note the difference in the placement of ""estate"") is that the winemaker selected lots from the vineyard that were considered more accessible, which in this case means more luscious. Despite its many charms, the wine should age for a long time."

Made from the highly regarded Hirsch Vineyard, it has a delicate body that explodes with flavors of tart, wild red berries, cola, baking spices and assorted forest-like notes—like pine needles, mushrooms and mulchy undergrowth. Just gorgeous now, and it should hold and develop over the next 6-8 years."

At the same time, it's vast in blackberry and cherry-jam flavors, while the oak overlay is strong but perfectly matched with the wine's volume. Very fine, complex and elegant, this is a Cabernet to cellar for eight years; it could be one for the long haul."
162592,Cabernet Sauvignon,Celani Family Vineyards 2008 Ardore Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,195,96,2008,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/celani-family-2008-ardore-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"Young and succulent, this is fresh, with ripe flavors of blackberries, cassis, chocolate and herb, with a toasty overlay of oak. Powerful, but not overbearing, this shows an internal coherence that lifts it to a high level of elegant complexity. As good as it is, it will benefit from 8-12 years in a proper cellar."
162593,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Riglos 2009 Gran Corte Las Divas Vineyard Red (Tupungato),Argentina,50,96,2009,Mendoza Province,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/riglos-2009-gran-corte-las-divas-vineyard-red-tupungato/,"This wine takes you on a trip to an outer wine world where deep, cushioned berry aromas come with exotic perfumes, bath oils and crushed flower petals. It's ultrasaturated and jammy, but not clunky or heavy. This tastes like a storm of blackberry, espresso and Swiss chocolate, while black spices and length bring up the rear. A blend of 50% Malbec, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cab Franc; drink now–2017."
162594,Pinot Noir,Rochioli 2010 West Block Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),US,100,96,2010,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/rochioli-2010-west-block-pinot-noir-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"We can quibble over whether the cherries are red or black, or if it's persimmons or pomegranates, or if the mushrooms are fresh or sautéed, but that's the point. This wine is so complex, it initiates discussion. Fine acidity and rich tannins provide structure, and although the wine is silky enough to enjoy now, you really want to give it 6–8 years."
163898,Cabernet Sauvignon,Jarvis 2006 Estate Grown Cave Fermented Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,245,96,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/jarvis-2006-estate-grown-cave-fermented-reserve-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"This reserve tastes oakier and stronger than Jarvis's regular 2006 Cabernet. With near-perfect balance, this is awesome. Flavors of blackberries and black currants are complexed with minerals and herbs and indefinable things from the soil. It's hard in tannins and rich in spicy, smoky new oak. Hold until at least 2014, and it should continue to age well beyond that."
164124,Rhône-style Red Blend,Alain Jaume et Fils 2009 Domaine Grand Veneur Vieilles Vignes Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),France,121,95,2009,Rhône Valley,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/alain-jaume-fils-2009-domaine-grand-veneur-vieilles-vignes-red-chateauneuf-pape/,"A prodigious effort, the 2009 Vieilles Vignes from Grand Veneur includes a whopping 40% Mourvèdre in the blend (there's also 10% Syrah, with the balance being Grenache), which no doubt accounts for its dark flavor profile. This is a full-bodied, lushly textured, expansive wine, with a finish that seems to go on forever. Approachable now, it should age well for 10–12 years at least."
164097,Rhône-style Red Blend,Maison Bleue 2010 Gravière Upland Vineyard Mourvèdre-Syrah-Grenache Red (Snipes Mountain),US,45,96,2010,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/maison-bleue-2010-graviere-upland-vineyard-mourvedre-syrah-grenache-red-columbia-valley-snipes-mountain/,"Clover, white pepper, and a whiff of animal make this blend of 75% Mourvèdre, 20% Syrah and 5% Grenache compelling now, but it's certainly a wine to cellar. The aromas move through a spectrum of flower, spice, fruit and animal. It already displays tremendous length and superb aging potential."
164098,Pinot Noir,Donum 2009 West Slope Estate Pinot Noir (Carneros),US,100,97,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/donum-2009-west-slope-estate-pinot-noir-napa-sonoma-carneros/,"A fabulous Pinot Noir that's rich and deeply flavored, with the most wonderful structure. After a fruity, spicy entry, the wine sinks down dramatically on the midpalate, offering masses of cherries, raspberries, red currants, cured meats, sautéed mushrooms, spices and sweetly toasted sandalwood. Bone dry, and capable of aging eight years in the cellar, it surpasses even the 2007 West Slope, arguably making it one of the greatest Carneros Pinot Noirs ever made."
164099,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Verité 2007 Le Desir Red (Sonoma County),US,450,97,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/verite-2007-le-desir-red-sonoma-county/,"A spectacular wine that defines the upper limit of California Bordeaux-style blends. Based on Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with splashes of Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec, this is delicious and complex, offering a blast of blackberry, blueberry-concentrate and mineral flavors. Comprised of fruit grown throughout Sonoma County, this is a masterpiece of the art of blending. Absolutely dry and very hard in tannins, drink this from 2013–2022."
164100,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Verité 2008 Le Desir Red (Sonoma County),US,450,97,2008,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/verite-2008-le-desir-red-sonoma-county/,"The 2008 vintage presented challenges for Cabernet Sauvignon, but this Cabernet Franc-based blend succeeds wildly. It's bone dry, tannic and enormously complex, with flavors of sour-cherry candy, red currant, licorice and spicy cola. Ninety-five percent new oak lends this a wonderful toastiness. Few wines could handle that much new wood, but this one can. However, it's very tannic. You can drink it now, but it should blossom after 2014."
164101,Merlot,Mt. Brave 2008 Merlot (Mount Veeder),US,60,98,2008,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/mt-brave-2008-merlot-napa-mount-veeder/,"A tremendous achievement in Merlot. The vineyard, around 1,600 feet up on Mt. Veeder, is now owned by the Jackson family, and the winemaker is Chris Carpenter, who oversees Cardinale. In fact, this Merlot bears an uncanny resemblance to Cardinale in the dramatically ripe, sweet fruit and superb, tannin-based structure. It's 100% Merlot, with hefty yet balanced alcohol, and the wine easily handles the 85% new French oak in which it was aged for 22 months."
164102,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt 2006 Plus Game Ranch Single Vineyard Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),US,150,98,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/goldschmidt-2006-plus-game-ranch-single-vineyard-selection-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-oakville/,"The 2006 vintage was erratic, but Nick Goldschmidt has pulled a rabbit out of a hat with this fabulously complex and rewarding 100% Cabernet. It's classic Oakville, dry, tannic and elegant, and the way the blackberry and black currant flavors marry the new oak is simply wonderful. The Game Ranch Vineyard has been source to some of Goldschmidt's greatest Cabernets over the past decade. This is one of those wines that's compelling to drink now, but should evolve over the next 10–15 years."
164104,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Verité 2007 La Muse Red (Sonoma County),US,450,100,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/verite-2007-muse-red-sonoma-county/,"This wine dazzles with perfection. Sourced from vineyards throughout Sonoma County, it refutes the belief that a great Cabernet must come from a single vineyard. It does not. The master's art of blending, coupled with demanding vineyard practices lends completeness. The blend is 85% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Malbec, making it an extraordinary success despite the absence of Cabernet Sauvignon. Give credit to winemaker Pierre Seillan. The wine itself is absolutely dry. It starts with a tug of tannins, baring flavors of blackberries, black currants, minerals and new oak, with earthy, herbal and meaty complexities. This is a magnificent wine; it dazzles now and should evolve over the next 6–8 years."
164096,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Verité 2007 La Joie Red (Sonoma County),US,450,96,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/verite-2007-joie-red-sonoma-county/,"The blend is mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other four classic Bordeaux varieties added for complexity. The grapes were sourced from vineyards throughout Sonoma County, and the finished wine was aged in 75% new oak. It's very fine, with concentrated, intense blackberry, cherry and crème de cassis flavors.Minerality, in the form of granite, lends a lick of stone. It's still extremely tannic, and needs much more timebefore it begins to come around."
164126,Cabernet Sauvignon,La Jota Vineyard 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),US,65,95,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/jota-vineyard-2009-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-howell-mountain/,"The tannins are so fierce on this baby Cabernet that they effectively lock it down and make it tough to drink now. Yet there's a fabulous core of blackberries that are rich, ripe and intense. Everything about it suggests ageability. Give it at least eight years in a proper cellar, and it could age even longer."
164127,Pinot Noir,Lynmar 2010 Quail Hill Vineyard Lynn's Blend Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),US,70,95,2010,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/lynmar-2010-quail-hill-vineyard-lynns-blend-pinot-noir-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"With fine acidity, grippy tannins and a tangy minerality, this Pinot offers complex flavors of sour-cherry candy, red currant, Dr. Pepper and spice that are laced with notes of dried herbs and white pepper. Turns dramatic on the midpalate, where the weight sinks in. Delicious now, this should develop over the next 6–8 years."
164129,Cabernet Sauvignon,Creō 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Chalk Hill),US,75,95,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/creo-2007-cabernet-sauvignon-sonoma-chalk-hill/,"This is quite an impressive Cabernet. The wine rivals an intense Napa Cabernet, with it's tannic structure and its bold flavors of blackberry, black currant and licorice that have been exquisitely oaked. It's elegantly drinkable now despite the power, but should comfortably glide through at least the next eight years."
164130,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Andrew Will 2009 Sorella Red (Horse Heaven Hills),US,75,95,2009,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/andrew-will-2009-sorella-red-columbia-valley-horse-heaven-hills/,"Sourced entirely from the Champoux Vineyard, this Bordeaux-style blend is two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon. Yummy from the first sniff to the last sip, it's packed with juicy berries and cassis, gracefully wrapped in layers of black olive, toast, clean earth and dark chocolate. Tannins are ripe and smooth."

Blended with a few drops of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it shows massive flavors of blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate and sweetly smoked cedar wood. Just superb and delicious, but tannic and locked down in astringency. If you can keep your hands off it, cellar this beauty. It should begin to come into its own around 2015 and go on for many more years."
165020,Portuguese Red,Niepoort 2009 Batuta Red (Douro),Portugal,100,95,2009,Douro,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/niepoort-2009-batuta-red-douro/,"Dark in color, this is a powerful, classic wine, with dense tannins. It has rich black-fruit flavors, and notes of wood and herb that are packed into its concentrated, dry structure. This is a great Douro for aging."
165166,Cabernet Sauvignon,Venge 2009 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,135,96,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/venge-2009-family-reserve-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"A massive wine, decadent and splendid, and a worthy followup to the near-perfect 2008. Densely packed in fruit, it explodes in blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, minerals and sweet, toasty new oak. That richness is lifted to brilliance by the tannic structure, which is world class. So deliciously approachable, it's drinkable now, but it should develop over the next 6–8 years. Beyond that, all bets are off, because this modern style of soft, relatively high-alcohol wines has yet to prove itself over the long haul."
165167,Pinot Noir,De Loach 2009 Pennacchio Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),US,45,96,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/loach-2009-pennacchio-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"With the 2009 vintage, De Loach is at the top of its Pinot Noir game, and this one, from a chilly vineyard south of Sebastopol, is among its best ever. The crisp acidity, like a squirt of lime, that accompanies the raspberry, cherry and persimmon fruit is bracing. Meanwhile, a mushroomy earthiness gives complex layers that don't stop. It should age through the next decade."
165168,Cabernet Sauvignon,Yao Ming 2009 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,625,97,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/yao-ming-2009-family-reserve-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"The former basketball star's initial release immediately establishes itself among the elite Cabernets of Napa Valley. Made from mountain vineyards on Atlas Peak and benches in the Rutherford appellation, it combines intensity with elegance. Bursts with upfront, delicious blackberry, crème de cassis and dark chocolate flavors that are wildly sweet on the midpalate, but then finish thoroughly dry. Structure comes by way of a tangy minerality and finely laced tannins. This is one of those wines that is softly decadent from start to finish, although it's probably not one to hold much beyond six years."
165157,Tannat,Alain Brumont 2006 Château Bouscassé Vieilles Vignes Tannat (Madiran),France,50,95,2006,Southwest France,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/alain-brumont-2006-chateau-bouscasse-vieilles-vignes-other-red-tannat-madiran/,"Some vines at Bouscassé are 150 years old, which inevitably give this wine great depth and concentration. It is hugely structured, with very rich, intense black-plum flavors. The tannins are still developing."

The blueberry and cherry fruit is wreathed in dried herbs and flowers. Fourteen months in French oak, roughly half new, adds a thread of vanilla bean. Loads of dried extract, polished tannins and moist earth bring in more nuances."
165159,Cabernet Sauvignon,Yao Ming 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,170,95,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/yao-ming-2009-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"A lovely Cabernet, richly attractive and deeply flavored in blackberries, blueberries and black currants. Made from vineyards scattered across Napa Valley, the wine has been blended with a splash of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. It shows a dramatic structure marked particularly by firm, smooth tannins, and it finishes dry. Shows the stuffing to age for 10-plus years, but it's polished enough to drink now, after decanting."
165160,Portuguese Red,Alvaro Castro 2008 Pape Red (Dão),Portugal,65,95,2008,Dão,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/alvaro-castro-2008-pape-red-dao/,"Here is a powerful, dense wine, with modest alcohol— thanks to the Dão's mountain climate and granite soil. Pape is a top wine from Alvaro Castro made predominantly from Touriga Nacional. Perfumed, elegant and structured, with plenty of concentration, this is a wine for serious aging."
165161,Cabernet Sauvignon,St. Supéry 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),US,85,95,2008,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/st-supery-2008-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-rutherford/,"This rich wine is a great success. It's enormously rich, almost flamboyant in blackberry jam, blueberry cobbler, anise and smoky new oak, as delicious as any Cabernet out there. Yet it shows a fine structure and relatively modest alcohol, a feature of the 2008 vintage. Good as it is now, you can safely cellar it for the rest of this decade and watch it evolve."

The fruit is dark, dense and ripe. There's extra roundness and density in the mouth that holds together the wine's firm tannins and its crisp, acidic component. Hold 10–20 more years."

Superrich and polished, but never over the top, this gorgeous super Tuscan shows deep layers of chocolate, black cherry, rum cake and spice. The secret lies in its balance: Everything is in place, from intensity and complexity to persistency."

Loads of aromatic momentum in the form of blackberry, cherry liqueur, spice, leather, tobacco, rum cake, cinnamon, vanilla bean and bitter chocolate characterize the bouquet. The wine also shows a soft, ripe, generous texture, yet remains well-contained and balanced."

Utterly delicious, with a silky, briskly clean mouthfeel. But the tannins are pronounced. They're not so strong as to lock the wine down, but do suggest time in the cellar. Give it four years, and it could be wonderful after 10 or more."
165948,Sangiovese Grosso,Valdicava 2006 Madonna del Piano Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),Italy,275,98,2006,Tuscany,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/valdicava-2006-madonna-piano-riserva-sangiovese-grosso-brunello-montalcino/,"This beautiful riserva shows enormous thickness and blackness, like midnight of a new moon. The wine delivers impenetrable density, extraction, black fruit, spice, berry preserves, licorice, asphalt, ground black pepper, cherry liqueur and crème de cassis. There are seemingly no limits to the intensity and complexity here. The mouthfeel is dense, plush, firmly structured and very long. Keep this Brunello safely in your cellar 20 years or more."

Blackberries, cassis and dark chocolate just begin to describe the flavors. They're as sweet as a dessert pastry, but the finish is utterly dry, a magic trick the best red wines pull off. Beautiful now after decanting, and should develop through 2018."

A complex nose greets you with a floral, dusty tickle, leading into a fruit-packed wine, with blueberry and black cherry most evident.

Call it feminine in its soft silkiness, and the way the raspberry, cherry and sandalwood flavors caress the palate. Yet there's a firmness of structure, a stony, minerally quality that lends power and authority. Great now, and will develop in the bottle for the next 6–8 years."
167584,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Arkenstone 2008 Obsidian Red (Howell Mountain),US,125,95,2008,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/arkenstone-2008-obsidian-red-napa-howell-mountain/,"Gigantic and impossibly tannic. Don't even think about drinking this Cabernet now. It's tightly wrapped in astringency, yet the molten core of blackberries, currants, blueberries and dark chocolate, and a firm minerality, almost guarantees extended aging through 2016, at least. It's a worthy followup to the 2006 and 2007."
167585,Cabernet Sauvignon,Woodward Canyon 2009 Artist Series #18 Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington),US,49,95,2009,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/woodward-canyon-2009-artist-series-18-cabernet-sauvignon-other/,"Here the high alcohol does not obscure the layered fruits and overall complexity of this exceptional Cabernet. Thick, ripe and richly endowed, it keeps its black fruit, ripe tannins and liquorous barrel notes all in proportion, and pulls in top flight fruit from Champoux, Sagemoor, the estate vineyard and other select sites. Earth, cedar and tobacco notes highlight the extended finish."
167586,Cabernet Sauvignon,Baldacci 2008 Brenda's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),US,105,95,2008,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/baldacci-2008-brendas-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-stags-leap-district/,"Huge, tremendous, authoritative and impressive for its sheer volume. It just explodes in blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, leather, dried herb and smoky oak flavors, with a tangy minerality. The vineyard is in the Stags Leap tenderloin, and the wine combines an approachable drink-me-now quality with obvious ageworthiness through at least 2016. Only 180 cases were produced."
167601,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Léoville Las Cases 2009  Saint-Julien,France,360,98,2009,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-leoville-las-cases-2009-red-saint-julien/,"A beautifully structured wine, with its tannins layered between the ripest black plums, damsons and black currants. It is opulent while remaining dense, concentrated and very serious. Certainly a wine for long-term aging."
168953,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Martin Ray 2007 Synthesis Red (Napa Valley),US,75,95,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/martin-ray-2007-synthesis-red-napa-valley/,"A terrific wine, smooth, complex and ageworthy. Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon from Diamond Mountain, it shows mountain intensity of fruit, with a molten core of blackberries and black currants. The tannins are bigtime, yet smooth and refined in the modern style, and the finish is elaborate in fruits and spices. A monument to what this fine winery can achieve at the top level. Hold until 2015, after which it should provide great drinking for additional years."

It is an exceptional expression of the Sonoma Coast, being translucent in color, dry, silky and crisp in acids. The flavors are complex and delicious, with berries, cherries and persimmons conjoined with mushrooms, spices and new oak. Lovely now, and should develop interestingly over the next 6–8 years."
168948,Cabernet Sauvignon,Renteria 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),US,60,95,2008,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/renteria-2008-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-stags-leap-district/,"This remarkable Cabernet was grown and produced by a longtime Mexican-American immigrant. It is an extraordinary wine, rich and full-bodied, explosive in sweetly ripe blackberries, cherries and black currants, yet given firmness by a firm minerality that must come from the soil. Defines André Tchelistcheff's description of Stags Leap Cabernets as an iron fist in a velvet glove. Drink now–2020."

It's so ripely exuberant in fruit, explosive in wild berry, dried red currant, licorice, cocoa and dusty spice flavors that sink deep into the palate and last forever on the finish. Yet it's dry, and the structure is entirely elegant. The two vineyards that are source to this wine are old and dry-farmed. A very great Dry Creek Valley Zinfandel, a real classic. Drink now–2015."

Blackberry tart, ripe blueberry, cassis, milk chocolate, licorice and sweet, smoky cedar flavors flood the mouth, dramatically huge and memorable, and lasting long into the finish. The tannins are obvious, but sweetly ripe and soft. A brilliant evocation of Napa Cabernet, despite a high production level of nearly 30,000 cases, which is about the same size as a Bordeaux first growth. Shows the class and potency this bottling has exhibited for many years, and believe it or not, the price is a relative bargain these days. Drink now–2020."
168959,Pinot Noir,Scott Paul 2009 Dix Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),US,40,96,2009,Oregon,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/scott-paul-2009-dix-pinot-noir-willamette-valley-dundee-hills/,"Wow, this is a glorious bottle of Pinot Noir. It was designed to celebrate the winery's 10th vintage (hence the name, Dix) and is a barrel selection of Maresh Vineyard grapes. Textural, lush, smooth, supple and utterly delicious, its red and black fruits are dappled with dusty spices, dusted with coffee grounds, and glide into a silky finish. Yummy beyond words."

It's rich in raspberry, pomegranate and persimmon fruit, elaborated with sweet new French oak, but saved from being merely ripe by a firm minerality and brilliant acidity. Should develop interestingly over the next 10 years."
169994,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande 2009  Pauillac,France,250,95,2009,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-pichon-longueville-comtesse-lalande-2009-red-pauillac/,"A seductive wine, deliciously ripe with the softest, juiciest fruit over smoky new wood.

In a successful year, it rivals Stag's Leap's best wines, including Cask 23, and 2008 was a very successful year. Blended with 2% Merlot, and aged in lots of new French oak, the wine is, in a word, stunning. Rich, flashy blackberry and dark chocolate flavors are anchored by an earthiness suggesting cured olives and dried herbs. Delicious now, this beauty should develop additional complexities throughout the decade."
170111,Syrah,Sequel 2008 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),US,50,95,2008,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/sequel-2008-shiraz-syrah-syrah-columbia-valley-wa/,"Bursting with sweet toast from the barrel aging, this offers ripe and pretty berry fruit, deep and long, with highlights of oolong tea.

At this stage it is very young, its superb dense fruit still developing. But the power, the rich tannins and the smooth feel from open stone fermenters still make this a wine that needs considerable aging. Give it 5–7 years and more."

Good as it is, it will gain traction over the next 15 years."

In its youth it's all about primary, jammy raspberry and cherry fruit. On the edges are fine acidity, smooth tannins and a perfect appliqué of oak. Shows the hallmarks of this great, emerging vineyard, but needs serious time to come around. Try after 2015."

This 2007 is right up there, rich, dense and opulent. It shows massive blackberry, cherry, blueberry, anise and cedar flavors, wrapped into a fine tannin-acid structure, and the finish is dry. Perfect with the best steak you can find."
170129,Cabernet Franc,Le Macchiole 2008 Paleo Cabernet Franc (Toscana),Italy,130,95,2008,Tuscany,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/le-macchiole-2008-paleo-cabernet-franc-toscana/,"Paleo is a landmark Italian expression of Cabernet Franc that is not at all bashful in terms of fullness and richness. Bold fruit and black cherry aromas have been soften by careful oak tones of spice and leather. Structured, firm but also velvety in texture, this wine needs more years to evolve."

But Olivet Lane Pinots are seldom delicate. You look for massive fruit and elaborate construction, and that's what you find in this fabulously exotic wine. It's a beauty, rich, dense and opulent, with complex cherry, rose petal, dark chocolate and new oak flavors, wrapped into firm, refined tannins. Just gorgeous now, with a few hours of decanting, but it will easily develop bottle nuances for a good eight years."
170132,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards 2009 Coopersmith Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),US,60,95,2009,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/merry-edwards-2009-coopersmith-pinot-noir-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"The vineyard is in the coolest part of the valley, the southerly part Merry Edwards calls the Golden Triangle.

Massively oaky, spicy and loaded with chunky ripe fruit, it's full-flavored and big-boned; a young, raw Cab with unlimited potential."

Big tannins and crisp acidity make it hard to appreciate now, but there's a gigantic core of cherries and raspberries, with a firm minerality from the soil. Will develop bottle complexity over the years. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2015."

It stands out in any tasting of its peers. Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, and aged in 60% new oak, it shows satisfying, complex flavors of blackberries, blueberries, cassis, hazelnut-infused chocolate and spices. Hard to exaggerate its power and grace. Wonderful now and for a good six years, but it's difficult to predict its evolution beyond 2018."

This Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc blend delivers thick concentration and sun-kissed aromas of black fruit, prune, dried bay leaf, black olive and tobacco. The thick, fertile soils that characterize the magical strip of coastal Tuscany at Bol-gheri help shape amazing richness and intensity."

Williams Selyem's last few vintages of Precious Mountain have been extraordinary, but this 2009 tops them all. The wine is as light as a feather in the mouth, modest in alcohol and delicately feminine, like pure satin. However, few Pinot Noirs in the world achieve this level of concentration. Wild raspberries and cherries, cola, sleek minerals, dusty baking spices and smoky oak combine for flavors that are utterly delicious. After all that, it possesses an indefinable attribute of fascination. Will age well for a long time, if you can keep your hands off it. Now–2021."

This always is a captivating wine, but the '09 is particularly scrumptious. Although it's quite tannic and acidic, it's forward enough in raspberries, cherries and cola to enjoy now. But it's bone dry and as elegant as California Pinot Noir gets. The balance suggests an ability to age for a good 10 years, if not longer."

It wasn't the easiest vintage, as 2007 was, but meticulous winemaking did the job, resulting in this amazingly rich, impressively ripe wine that's drinkable now and will develop for many years. The fruits veer toward blackberries, cherries and cola, and the tannins are soft and refined. One hundred percent new French oak isn't at all heavy, lending nuances of buttered toast and sweet wood tannins. Will easily age for 15 years."

This is Zinfandel on steroids, a monster of wild summer berry, tobacco, currant and spice flavors, wrapped into significantly thick tannins. Yet despite the power, it never quite loses elegance and balance. The winery's 2007 was their greatest Zinfandel ever, and this one isn't far behind."

Pours pale in color and translucent, suggesting it's not a heavy fruit bomb, and indeed it is not. Feels as light as a cloud, yet with intense flavors of red stone fruits, bacon and spices, and that feral, wild forest quality you get from the best Sonoma Coast Pinot Noirs.

All the fruit is sourced from the Morrison Lane vineyard. Port-like and amazingly concentrated, it's about as far as a dry wine can go and show fruit that is not buried in new oak. Here the fruit is a dark blend of berries and cassis; there is a dense layer of chocolate and earth underneath, with a finish loaded with baking spices."

It's edgy and tight, with sharply defined corners—herbal, with a leafy/stemmy note, well-integrated into wild, brambly berry fruits. The 50% new oak is virtually invisible at this point; it fills out the mouthfeel but does not show specifically."
171301,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,K Vintners 2008 Ovide En Cerise Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),US,60,95,2008,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/k-vintners-2008-ovide-en-cerise-vineyard-red-blend-cabernet-sauvignon-syrah-columbia-valley-walla-walla-wa/,"Sourced from another of the Cayuse vineyards, this is two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon and one-third Syrah—a proven blend in Walla Walla.

Dry and full-bodied, this wine is spectacularly rich in blackberries, cassis and minerals and is well oaked. What's most remarkable is the quality of the tannins. They're firm, yet soft and sweetly refined. A tremendous accomplishment, and should develop in the bottle for a decade. At this price, an outstanding value."

It's not hard for Napa to ripen fruit to blackberry and cherry perfection, or for the winemaker to age the wine in the best oak. What's difficult is to house all this richness in such smooth tannins, with such depth and such a pure finish. A spectacularly good wine to drink now, and it should develop for at least a decade."

Impressive for the sheer density of fruit, namely blackberries, cherries and chocolate, accented with buttery, caramelized new oak perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume. The tannins are soft, sweet and intricate. Despite the richness, There's a firm minerality that adds to the structure and grounds it. So opulently delicious, you could drink it now, and it should develop in the bottle over the next six years, at least."

Potent and powerful, bursting with berries and plums, scented with the aromas of earth and sweet (not dried) herb, chicken stock and flavors that run through the same exotic range.

Instead, it's about ageability. Made from 100% Cabernet grown in two very different places, Pritchard Hill and Coombsville, it's dry and refined. Floods the mouth with blackberry, blueberry, cassis, dark chocolate, spice and new oak flavors whose richness is tempered by a firm minerality. Really fabulous in all respects, but so delicious now, it makes you wonder why you should even risk more than six years in the cellar."
174927,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Merryvale 2008 Profile Red (Napa Valley),US,165,97,2008,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/merryvale-2008-profile-red-napa-valley/,"A tremendous wine that shows how Merryvale is absolutely at the top of its game. Impeccable in structure, with refined tannins that are soft and firm at the same time, and a fine cut of acidity. Entirely dry, the Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend is awesome in blackberry, cherry, cassis and oak flavors, with complexities of anise, soy sauce, grilled meats and minerals.

In the nose it's hugely expressive, though still quite tight and compact in the mouth; it must be decanted. It's a three ring circus of a wine, with things moving and shaking in all directions. Mineral, berry, mountain complexity, nuanced herb and earth and citrus, all in proportion, and all flowing in the mouth."

True, it's not the most drinkable of their wines, at this time, but it easily is the most intense and concentrated. Dazzles with a molten core of sweet blackberries, blueberries and cassis, deep and long in the finish. Don't insult it by drinking before 2013, but you're better served by holding for far longer, even into the 2020s."

They've handled this finicky variety just right, although surely the addition of some Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec adds weight and tone. The wine is dry, richly tannic and enormously flavorful, offering waves of cherries, red currants, red licorice, cola, sweet cedar wood and even savory hints of bacon. A tremendous Cabernet Franc that will stand as a definitive version in California."

It is power-packed with dense, rich flavors, nuanced with exotic spices and black tea, moving into silky tannins and an extremely long, satisfying finish."

A 100% Cabernet, its grapes come from a vineyard in eastern St. Helena, off the Silverado Trail. Cab's usual blackberries and cassis are there, along with classic elements of green olives and herbs, with a funkiness that adds an umami tang. Very finely constructed, very complex, spicy and delicious. Give it six years, at least."

Sourced from Champoux and Weinbau, just three barrels were made. The fruit is deeply flavored with black cherry and cassis, and the tannins seem darker, earthier, toastier and overall fuller than any of the other excellent Januik reds. Still young and tight, this promises to blossom over time with floral, earth, barrel and spice highlights."

There's so much going on here, it's hard to know where to begin. Explosive in grilled meats, blackberries, plum jam, licorice, coffee, chocolate, caramel, black pepper and Chinese 5 spice, yet bone dry, with smooth, rich tannins. Extraordinarily good now, and should develop in interesting ways. Certainly one of the best California Syrahs of the last few vintages."

It bursts in the mouth with mushu plum sauce and cherry fruit and the most marvelous feral notes of mushrooms, minerals, hung meat, forest spices and herbs. It's quite a tannic wine, giving it a brooding quality. Huge, massive, stunning. Should glidepath through the next 6–8 years."

As it opens in the glass, the aromas display incense scents, and there is assertive, blocky, chewy fruit––especially black cherry. The tannins are also bigger, blockier, more substantial than the Cabernet. With hours of breathing time, exotic spices (saffron and more) emerge."

The fruit is pure and juicy, a riot of blueberry, blackberry and cassis. There is a focused thread of fresh herb and as the nose expands the baking spices kick in beautifully. A wine to study and explore; it can continue to evolve for hours, if not days."

The vines have reached a mature stage that amplifies the fruit and keeps the generous barrel flavors in perfect balance. The barrel notes roll on in a chorus of toasty accents, and the finish is as good in the last minute as the first whiff from the glass."

The sweet black fruit is potentially enormous, still finding its place among the tannins. Spice, with a mineral streak, gives the wine added complexity. Very dense in texture, this will age 10 years and many more."

Just dazzles with the intensity of cherries, black raspberries, Dr. Pepper, plums, sweet vanilla-scented sandalwood and a wild array of savory spices. The wine is a small-production barrel selection from the estate vineyard, which is in the heart of the Green Valley. Drink now and through 2013, at least."

It's irresistible because of its brilliant, but simple, philosophy. Traditional Nebbiolo tones of cola, licorice and pressed violets are set beautifully against modern tones of spice, chocolate and vanilla. It's the integration of these two extremes that make this Barolo so important."
177364,Pinot Noir,Domaine Jacques Prieur 2009 Musigny  (Musigny),France,510,96,2009,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-jacques-prieur-2009-musigny-pinot-noir-musigny/,"A sumptuous wine, rich in bright red fruits, with a structure and depth of flavor to match.

If this had a Napa Valley label on it, it could sell for three times the price. The structure is full and fleshy, but with the vividly bright fruit that screams Washington State. Juicy acidity underscores the berries, cherries and plums; the generously applied new oak adds texture and layers of caramel, coconut and chocolate. A bottle that belongs with Washington's (and California's) best."

The long finish is soft and velvety, but the tannins and acidity guarantee a long future ahead."

This region normally produces Pinots with crisp acidity and fine varietal character, and so it is here, with its cherry, black raspberry, red currant and sandalwood flavors. But there's extra depth and complexity, with a wildly exotic, spicy edge, that lift the wine into greatness. Right up there with the best of coastal California. Hard to tell where it's going, but give it a good decant before serving."

It's riper and juicier than the '06, showing the babyfat of this famous vintage. But it's no less complex or ageworthy, just drinkable earlier. Shows concentrated blackberry, black currant, anise, licorice and smoky oak flavors, wrapped into dramatic, thick, firm tannins. Should develop over the next decade and beyond."

So delicious and complex now in wild cherry, raspberry, Dr. Pepper cola, bacon and smoky sandalwood flavors, brightened with crisp acidity and totally dry despite the fruitiness. But you'll also find a firm tannic structure that gives it some astringency. It's the kind of Pinot Noir that California does at its best, drinkable now for sheer beauty, but easily capable of a decade of aging."

It's bone dry and rich in stimulating acidity, and the cherry and raspberry fruit flavors have an earthy, mushroomy quality that grounds the wine and gives it a real sense of terroir. Shows the fleshy attractions of the amazing '07 vintage, with an undisputed capacity to age. Now–2017, at least."
181042,Cabernet Sauvignon,Venge 2008 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),US,125,99,2008,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/venge-2008-family-reserve-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-oakville/,"An absolute joy and triumph. Just superb, showcasing the best of Oakville. Perfect tannins, as pure as velvet and sweet, and perfect oak, too, with beautifully applied char and wood spice. That the oak is 100% new is in keeping with the wine's volumetrics. The wine's flavors are a profound, heady expression of blackberries, blueberries, cassis and dark, barely sweetened chocolate. Just spectacular, a real achievement by any world class standard. Production was a scant 275 cases."

Dry and vital in concentrated blackberry and currant flavors, with a rich appliqué of smoky oak, it announces its terroir with authority. But it's extraordinarily tannic, and needs lots of time. Try after 2015."

It's an exotic wine, spicy and peppery, almost briary, like a Zinfandel, except with flavors of wild forest raspberries, cherries, orange zest and a hint of pine cone. It's as cellarable a Pinot Noir as exists in California. Best after 2015."

With relatively modest alcohol, it offers an elegant and refreshing alternative to the heavy style of many California Pinot Noirs. Offers notes of earth, cherries, mushrooms, spices and sweet sandalwood."

The flavors are deep and complex, changing with every second as the wine breathes. Raspberries, wild clove and cinnamon spices, cola, dried herbs, things that taste earthy and minerally and woodsy. Insanely complex and dynamic, this Pinot should age for up to eight years."

The wine is the opposite of a fruit bomb, with moderate alcohol and interesting flavors of herbs, cherries, blackberries and spicy sandalwood. As good as it is now, it should ride out the next 8–10 years."

It's a big, dry, muscular wine, assertive in tannins, with mineral-driven blackberry and black currant flavors. Muscular and intense, it should provide great drinking starting in 2015 and for many years after. A very great expression of its vineyard, which is basically the old Beringer State Lane Vineyard."

Stuns with its soft,  complex, black and blue berry, teriaki beef, black pepper and sandalwood flavors. The depth is unbelievable, the length impressive. Clearly a first growth Syrah, and should develop bottle complexity for the next six years, if not longer."

Hard to exaggerate the beauty. Powerful, yet never pushy, with classic Napa balance. Rich, sweet, almost meaty, with massive tannins that are refined and smooth. Very great density and weight. Really defines the vineyard, and should age effortlessly for 20 years"

But the oak is perfectly in keeping with the wine's massive power. Underneath the wood char is a dry, tannic wine with rich blackberry and currant flavors. It's a bit disjointed now, needing time for everything to mesh together. Could be really something around 2015."

It detonates on the palate with an explosion of cherries and raspberries, and wonderfully smoky, buttery complexities from oak. Drily crisp and finely structured in smooth, dense tannins, it offers great pleasure now, and should develop over the next 6–8 years. Production was low, but it's worth a search."

The fruit is immaculate, the concentration focused and lengthy, and the flavors are so artfully blended that the wine is seamless and perfectly balanced. Although it is drinking like a mature wine, there is every reason to cellar wines such as this—it can develop like a fine Burgundy, over decades."

How they take basic Russian River Valley cherry, raspberry and cola flavors and uplift the wine into the extraordinarily exotic is inexplicable. But they do. An amazingly complex, compelling young Pinot Noir. Drink now–2019, at least."

The tannins are sweet and ripe, and the wine brims with luscious blackberry, cassis and mocha flavors, accented with new oak that's flashy, yet perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume. Should slowly mature over the years."

The wine is awesome, vast and complex, fascinating in every aspect, yet locked down in tough tannins that exaggerate the acidity, making the wine functionally undrinkable. It is a beautiful, classic Cabernet, very near perfect, and certainly one of the successes of the vintage. Don't even think of drinking it before 2014, and it should evolve in the bottle for a good 10 years after that."

There's extreme balance and sophistication evident in the focused aromas of wild berry, white licorice, pressed violets and polished stone. The mouthfeel is tight, firm and those tannins need at least 10 more years to soften in your cellar. Beautiful."

The riper blackberries and black cherries have a chewy, meaty edge, with notes of cola and bacon. Very fine tannins and acidity suggest midterm to longterm aging, but it's a splendid sipper now. Should develop through 2018, at least."

It's absolutely delicious, dazzling showing blackberry tart, cherry pie with the sweet, smoky crust, cassis and baking spice flavors, wrapped into wonderfully thick, fine tannins. Pure California fruit, but dry, balanced and nuanced. A classic, but high-alcohol haters will find plenty to complain about. Drink now–2020."

Completely dry, with exquisite tannins, its blackberry, currant, red licorice and oak-inspired flavors are massive and classic. Hard to exaggerate how good this fine wine is. Drink 2013–2020 and beyond."

Shows huge waves of blackberries, black currants and cassis, dark chocolate, earthy minerals and considerable oak, which is tasteful and unobtrusive, With its dryness and perfect balance, it will easily negotiate the years. Should be fine well past the year 2020."
182314,Nebbiolo,Gaja 2006 Sperss Nebbiolo (Langhe),Italy,255,98,2006,Piedmont,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/gaja-2006-sperss-nebbiolo-langhe/,Sperss (the name is inspired by the local word for “nostalgia”) is a vineyard located in the Barolo territory of Serralunga. Angelo Gaja adds 6% Barbera to the wine for brightness and freshness but the overall ensemble shows so much more than that. It delivers sophisticated softness and a velvety texture that is backed by exotic spice and loads of wild berry and licorice. Add huge depth and intensity and you have the criteria for a cellar-worthy wine. Will be ready to drink after 2020.

There's enormous beauty and elegance here, backed by power and intensity with ripe fruit, spice, toasted nut and cola. It also shows impressive linearity and focus. Hold for 10 years or more."

It has a dense, complex core of blackberries, coated with immaculately fine, sweet oak. Feels important and dramatic, but too young. Begs to be housed in a good cellar for a good eight years."
182304,Nebbiolo,Gaja 2006 Costa Russi Nebbiolo (Langhe),Italy,420,95,2006,Piedmont,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/gaja-2006-costa-russi-nebbiolo-langhe/,"Purchased by the Gaja family in 1967, the Costa Russi vineyard produces elegant expressions of Nebbiolo with beautifully saturated, sun-drenched flavors. Indeed, this vintage shows wild berry with beautiful background renderings of smoke and graphite. Five percent Barbera is added and the wine shows amazing harmony and sophistication with bright acidity and firm tannins. It will only become more beautiful in time."

Withholds its best under a cloak of astringency, but already shows its mountain terroir in the complexity of its structure and deep, intense blackberry, currant, blueberry and dried herb flavors. Should develop bottle complexities for at least a decade and probably longer."

It's a big wine, voluminous in tannins and extremely mouth-filling, and the blackberry and cassis flavors have elements of dried herbs, minerals, tobacco and cedar. Already throwing some sediment, it should develop in the bottle for at least the next eight years."
182307,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stonestreet 2007 Christopher's Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),US,100,96,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/stonestreet-2007-christophers-cabernet-sauvignon-sonoma-alexander-valley/,"Grown in a portion of the winery's considerable holdings in the high Mayacamas range, this Cabernet is ridiculously rich and flamboyant in black currant flavors, wrapped into the ripest, densest, sweetest tannins imaginable. Exceptionally vibrant, intense and compact, it will develop bottle complexity for a good 15 years."

Complex and satiny, it's a riveting wine, inky and bursting with a sensuous mix of berry, cassis, mocha, loam, cinnamon and spice. Tremendous density and depth; despite its youth the wine curls around the tongue like thick smoke, showing more and more detail."

The year 2007 gave California supernaturally rich but balanced Pinot Noirs, and this is one of them. It's sensational, offering broad, exotic fruit flavors, pinpointed with exotic spices, and exquisitely highlighted with French oak. Truly fine, this small-production wine should age over the next 6–8 years."

A low yield, pure varietal wine, it is immensely concentrated, deeply flavored with cassis, cherry, and berry fruit that is substantial and detailed, with a light dappling of dried herb, chocolate powder, licorice and dark, earthy components typical of Cayuse."
186237,Syrah,Cayuse 2007 Bionic Frog Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),US,75,98,2007,Oregon,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/cayuse-2007-bionic-frog-shiraz-syrah-syrah-other-walla-walla-valley-or/,"Often considered the iconic Cayuse wine, this bears the cartoonish label with the leering frog, though it is a single-vineyard offering like the others. Initially showing some fat and sweetness, it is supple and textural, with the density that comes from a mix of flavors: pain grillé, smoke, umami, fungus, coffee grounds and dark fruits. A richly organic compendium of scents and flavors, with black tea tannins."
186239,Syrah,Cayuse 2007 En Cerise Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),US,65,98,2007,Oregon,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/cayuse-2007-en-cerise-vineyard-shiraz-syrah-syrah-other-walla-walla-valley-or/,"Aromatic and invited, almost jet black in color, this single-vineyard offering is a pungent mix of blood orange, rosemary and cassis. Dense and focused, compact and layered, it is structured very much like a Cabernet, but with a full palette (and palate) of Syrah fruit flavors."

This fine follow-up to the 2006 features a little more delicacy, with a lovely floral component and some earth. The depth is astonishing in the weight and texture and the way the wine plays out across the palate. The finish never ends: a glorious mix of black cherry, earth, herb, spice, and rock."

The wine has a floral top, a thickly fruity middle and a base with smoke, rock and meat. Still very young, it is already a complete, fully-realized, near-perfect wine with a finish that extends for many minutes. This should age for 25 –30 years. Right now, it's almost frozen in place; still a bit tannic, but with superb aging potential."

It's smooth and silky, with a tongue-bending blend of flavors that include blood and iron, umami and salt, at first overtaking the pure fruit, but adding tremendous depth and power. The endless finish unfolds into a wine with exotic spices and complex layering."

It smells like a fine Bordeaux, still very young and tight, with well-defined layers of flavor. Black cherry, cassis, lead pencil, smoke and baking spices are tightly stacked and particularly apparent in the aromas. Give this one a decade or more in the cellar; if you are drinking now, decant for at least two hours."

Takes the blackberries and black currants of Cabernet Sauvignon, merges them with Syrah's bacon and pepper, flirts with Grenache's cherries, and then uplifts it all with Viognier's citrusy brightness and acidity. A compelling wine that will hold through 2013."

In the wrong hands these low-yielding grapes might have been mishandled, but Dry Creek Vineyard knows Zinfandel. The result is superb, spectacular, the essence of old vine Sonoma. Rich, dry and pure, it's enormously complex in briary, peppery wild berries, with a delicious edge of sweet raisins. Drink now for sheer deliciousness."

Le Méal gets the nod this year as the most powerful of the group, with massive espresso and black olive elements tinged with meat and underlain by a bed of ripe blueberries. Long and mouthwatering on the finish, look for this wine to approach maturity by 2016; drink well through 2025 or longer."
186220,Syrah,Sanguis 2007 The Oracle of Delphi Syrah (California),US,85,95,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/sanguis-2007-oracle-delphi-shiraz-syrah-syrah-other/,"A brilliant Syrah, showing its cool-climate origins with a burst of white pepper. Much of the fruit comes from the Bien Nacido Vineyard, and the Syrah contains 4% Viognier. Firm tannins and fine acidity give this delicious wine structure, but it's mostly notable for the extraordinary depth and length of its blackberry, currant, teriaki beef, mushroom and cedar flavors. The wine easily stands up to 100% new French oak casks."
186223,Corvina,Zenato 2004 Riserva Sergio Zenato  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),Italy,130,95,2004,Veneto,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/zenato-2004-riserva-sergio-red-amarone-della-valpolicella-classico/,"Gorgeous, rich and penetrating, this wine excels in terms of the elegance of its aromas.

Tasted now, it's dryly tannic, with the black currant and crème de cassis flavors buried under a cloak of astringency. New oak, which comprises 80% of the barrels, adds even greater tannins. Give this wine at least six years, and it should continue to blossom in a good cellar for another decade."

Deep and textural, it packs together concentrated red fruits, preserves and cassis. At first it shows a little heat from the 15% alcohol, but as it breathes open over hours (and even days) the primary fruit gives way to subtle veins of olive, earth, coffee and toast."
187557,Red Blend,Tenuta San Guido 2007 Sassicaia  (Bolgheri Sassicaia),Italy,220,95,2007,Tuscany,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/tenuta-san-guido-2007-sassicaia-red-bolgheri-sassicaia/,"This iconic Italian wine from Bolgheri's landmark Sassicaia vineyard (characterized by little rocks, or “sassi”) offers an elegant bouquet comprised in equal measure by mineral, fruit and spice nuances. The wine consists of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Cabernet Franc and the finish is long, smooth and very fine. This is an ageworthy wine that should not be opened before 2018."
187569,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rubicon Estate 2007 Cask Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),US,75,95,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/rubicon-estate-2007-cask-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-rutherford/,"Gorgeous, elegant and ageworthy. With a softly tannic structure, it's drinkable now, but should age and gain complexity for 10 years.

Its core fruit is supple and compact cassis and black cherry, with a spicy top note that resonates well into the finish. Concentrated and beautifully proportioned, with black olive and just a hint of leaf in the finish."

The bouquet is intense, with minerality, char, huge black-fruit aromas and handsome shadings of chocolate and coffee. Power and purity come on like gangbusters, and the flavors are a classic mix of blackberry, cassis and fine Swiss chocolate. Heady, smooth and impressive. My highest rated wine yet from Carlos Pulenta's Vistalba label. Drink now through 2014. Composed of 87% Malbec with Bonarda and Cabernet Sauvignon."

It's hard, with a bite of acidity, but it doesn't take much for the richness to explode. Blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate, butterscotch, sweet cinnamon spice, the list goes on and on. So rich and decadent, you can enjoy it now, but it will gather momentum over the next 6–8 years."

Messorio is all Merlot, and happily delivers the softness, richness and overall opulence that we love in this noble grape variety.

Shows a great structure of acidity and tannins, with a cedar and sweet tobacco earthiness. Yet it's also explosive in blackberries, black cherries, red and black currants and anise liqueur. A real accomplishment, and a great compliment to the high-altitude Stagecoach Vineyard, which straddles the Atlas Peak and Napa Valley appellation lines. Drink now–2016."

Quite dry and tannic in youth, it shows an astringency that strongly suggests the cellar. Underneath are powerhouse flavors of blackberries, black and red cherries, spices, tea and cedar.

The fruit is massive, suggesting black and red sour cherry candy, with oak influences of smoky char and pencil shavings, and complex notes of minerals and sweet violet flowers. But it all needs time to come together. Tasted in a large flight of 2007 Rutherford Cabernets and Bordeaux blends, this was easily the star. Really hard to exaggerate the wine's beauty and elegance. Best 2013–2019, at least."

We're talking pure velvet, the way the wine glides over the palate with hardly a wrinkle. Beyond the mouthfeel are flavors so complex, they're hard to describe. The blend consists of Cabernet Sauvignon, with contributions from Cab Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, and each grape brings its own distinction, as does 100% new oak. It's approachable now for the softness, and should glide through the next 6–8 years with ease. Expensive, yes, and only 344 cases were produced, but it's worth the search."

If you enjoy sheer, decadent deliciousness in your Pinot Noirs, this is one for you. The palate first is struck by the rich waves of cherry pie filling, raspberry essence and sweet, vanilla-tinged, smoky oak. Then it discovers the soft silkiness, and finally the firm, fine tannins kick in, providing structure. Just beguiling, and should develop in the bottle over the next 5–6 years."

This is an exuberant wine with thickly extracted notes of coffee bean, blackberry, leather and savory layers of black pepper. The wine is rich, smooth and velvety and will appeal less to Nebbiolo traditionalists."

It's a low-yield wine, aged in 50% new French oak that adds a rich, smoky vanilla coat to the raspberry and cherry jam, spice and mineral flavors. No stems were included in the fermentation, which accounts for the silky transparency. This compelling Pinot changes with every scent and sip. now–2013."

It has the density and compact structure of Quilceda Creek, with perhaps just a shade less concentration. Aromatically complex, you can pick out early details of seed, coffee, pepper, chocolate and tobacco around the dense cassis, plum and cherry fruit. But this wine is truly a baby, and should not be touched for a decade or more."

Superb now, and should develop over the next six years."

A Bordeaux blend based mainly on Cabernet Sauvignon, it has too many flavors to list, but blackberries, dark chocolate, orange peel, red licorice, bacon and dusty Indian spices surely top the list, wrapped into soft but super fine tannins. Really a first-rate wine that earns a place in the Napa pantheon. Now–2015, in a good cellar."

Comes down on the drier, lower alcohol and less ripe side than many Cabs in its league, yet lacks for nothing in complexity and sheer deliciousness. Tantalizes with blackberry tart, cherry, carob bean and a Pinot Noir-esque cola-rhubarb richness that retreats behind rich tannins and an earthiness suggesting sweet blond tobacco and dried sage. Clearly ageable, it will develop bottle complexity over the next 12 years, at least. It's 94% Cabernet Sauvignon, with a few drops of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot."

Only produced in excellent vintages, the 2004 expression shows amazing concentration, balance, complexity, depth and personality. Aromas include black cherry, cola, light smoke, graphite and moist tobacco. The mouthfeel is deep, penetrating and long lasting with tight but polished tannins. Drink after 2015."

It's so delicious, you can hardly stop drinking it. Just oozes in raspberry and red cherry purée and caramelized, smoky oak richness, yet is thoroughly dry. An amazing, unforgettable wine that establishes a new benchmark for California Grenache from this winery that was an early pioneer in Rhône varieties."

Aromas of fresh mountain herbs pour forth from the glass along with the scents of cherry, cough drop and dried spices. Very light on its feet with pronounced elegance as opposed to raw power. The palate is sleek and feminine, with flavors of dried red fruits, raspberry and light medicinality. Spectacular as per usual, with 85% Tempranillo and 15% Cab Sauvignon. Drink now–2025."

Cerretalto is a cru selection riserva and represents one of the most modern, fruit-forward and boldest expressions from the Montalcino territory."

Stuns with the complexity of its cherries, raspberries and cola, with fantastically spicy notes. Hard to describe just how intricate it feels, changing by the second as the palate uncovers additional nuances. The vineyard, which is in Green Valley, is coveted among Pinot Noir winemakers. A very great Pinot Noir, defining silkiness and delicacy, and should age effortlessly for at least the next six years."

Aged 24 months in American oak then 12 more months in French barrels, this GR is leathery and powerful, with firm tannins supporting dry berry fruit flavors accented by copious amounts of tobacco, mint, vanilla and more. Will continue to age and soften; drink now through 2025."

Comprised of all five Bordeaux varieties, it's bone dry, enormously complex and firmly masculine, with very big, hard tannins. Concentration on the flavors shows layers of blackberries, black currants, blueberries, mocha, violets, sweet charred oak and a firm grounding of minerals. An outstanding wine from the Pritchard Hill region east of the Silverado Trail, but one that needs cellar time to resolve the tannins. Better after 2013, and should develop for many years after that."
191782,Sangiovese Grosso,Altesino 2004 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),Italy,80,96,2004,Tuscany,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/altesino-2004-riserva-sangiovese-grosso-brunello-montalcino/,"This stunning wine boasts loads of character that peels off as aromatic layers of cherry, cassis, soapy wild flowers, violets, earth, cola and church incense. There's a sweet spice element of cinnamon and nutmeg and all the flavors last long on the finish. It's tempered, elegant and smooth overall."
191783,Tempranillo,Aalto 2006  Ribera del Duero,Spain,55,96,2006,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/aalto-2006-tempranillo-ribera-duero/,"Mariano Garcia's deft winemaking touch and propensity for making monster RDDs is etched into this massive, extracted heavyweight, and wow is it good! After a touch of early heat, there's dusty black fruit aromas, spice galore, floral notes and then a huge palate of raw blackness and finally an explosion of creamy mocha, vanilla and woodspice. Needs a couple of more years but not 10 or 20."
191784,Tempranillo,Aalto 2006 PS  (Ribera del Duero),Spain,115,97,2006,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/aalto-2006-ps-tempranillo-ribera-duero/,"A beautiful but enormous style of red wine with char, leather and saturated black fruit aromas. There's also some lemony oak that will shed itself with time. Overall, it's rich, delicious and a real fruit bomb with chocolate, vanilla, caramel, coffee and mocha, all of which are reflections of the oak aging it sees. PS stands for  s seleccionados, and it's really an example of the new school in full session. Best 2013–2017 due to its heft and extraction."
191785,Tempranillo,Viña Sastre 2005 Regina Vides  (Ribera del Duero),Spain,195,98,2005,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/vina-sastre-2005-regina-vides-tempranillo-ribera-duero/,"From vines that are between 80 and 100 years, this is a marvelous example of top-notch Spanish red wine, regardless of region and grape variety. Hails from four vineyards, and the product is dark, concentrated, sultry, masculine and impressive. Giant black fruit flavors, texture, richness, coffee and cola make it truly special. Drinkable now; best in 3–5 more years."
191786,Tempranillo Blend,Viña Sastre 2006 Pesus  (Ribera del Duero),Spain,750,100,2006,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/vina-sastre-2006-pesus-tempranillo-blend-ribera-duero/,"If there's any such thing as the perfect Spanish red, Pesus is it. A blend of 80% Tempranillo with other grapes including Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine sees 200% new oak, resulting in a thick, dark, tannic beauty that bubbles over with toast, cola, mint, chocolate and spice aromas. The mouth is sheer heaven; a mile deep in terms of berry flavor and more, but faultless and smooth. Shows outstanding structure and power, and should age well for 15–20 years. Hails from two 100-year-old vineyards and some baby vines with but 25 years of age. Crazy expensive but only 150 cases were made; drink 2013–2030."
191957,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Mondavi 2007 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,135,95,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/robert-mondavi-2007-reserve-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"Bone dry and utterly balanced, with deeply powerful, long-lasting flavors of blackberries and black currants and an intense, but integrated, coating of smoky oak. But it's also very tannic. Nothing soft about this wine. As fine a cellar candidate as any Mondavi Reserve in years. Should develop for 12, 15, even 20 years."
191763,Sangiovese Grosso,Valdicava 2004 Madonna del Piano Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),Italy,186,95,2004,Tuscany,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/valdicava-2004-madonna-piano-riserva-sangiovese-grosso-brunello-montalcino/,Here's a dark and well concentrated Brunello Riserva with meaty tones of smoked ham or bresaola backed by black cherry and prune. You'll get loads of leather and tobacco and the wine is bright and tart on the close with a fresh fruit finale. Excellent.
191764,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trinchero 2007 Cloud's Nest Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),US,50,95,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/trinchero-2007-clouds-nest-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-mount-veeder/,"A lovely Cabernet, brimming with complex blackberry, cherry, mineral, tobacco and cedar flavors that impress for their sheer power. Shows the firm, hard tannins this mountain always lends Cabs, but they're so finely ground, the wine is drinkable now with a good decanting. Should age well for a decade."
191765,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ghost Block 2007 Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville),US,100,95,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/ghost-block-2007-single-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-yountville/,"A terrific Cabernet you want to cellar for a good 5–6 years, at the very least, and could go far longer. Shows what Yountville can do in a good year. The wine is very dry and more minerally than further north, yet is extraordinarily rich in blackberries, chocolate-covered cherries and cassis, with a perfumed scent of violets. The mouthfeel is all velvet and satin—so pretty and refined."
191766,Sangiovese Grosso,Uccelliera 2004 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),Italy,112,95,2004,Tuscany,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/uccelliera-2004-riserva-sangiovese-grosso-brunello-montalcino/,"Uccelliera is among an elite group that represents the best of the best of Montalcino. This gorgeous wine is intense and generous with nice concentration and layered aromas of cherry, blackberry, spice, blackberry and plum. The mouthfeel is smooth and rich and the wine promises many happy years ahead. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers."

The complex and site-specific aromas suggest wild herb, lavender, lemon verbena and black olive. The tannins are supple and ripe, with no green edge at all. The fruit combines mineral-soaked black cherry, sweet raspberry compote, and deep cassis. A marvelous wine, dense, detailed and seductive."
193066,Cabernet Sauvignon,Steven Kent 2007 Ghielmetti Vineyard Clone 4 Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),US,100,95,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/steven-kent-2007-ghielmetti-vineyard-clone-4-cabernet-sauvignon-central-coast-livermore-valley/,"There's a beautiful wine in here, but it's buried under tannins. Also, the fruit is all primary blackberry, blueberry, raspberry and cherry jam, while the oak stands to the side, insistent in vanilla and toast. Nothing has merged, everything is separated. Yet this is a great wine, easily the greatest Cabernet to emerge from Livermore Valley in memory. Beautiful now, and should develop for a decade."
193067,Pinot Noir,Fulcrum 2008 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),US,52,95,2008,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/fulcrum-2008-gaps-crown-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-coast/,"Big and powerful, but nuanced despite its size. It's a dark, extracted wine, filled with wild cherry, raspberry, currant and sandalwood flavors, as well as exotic notes of forest balsam, grilled mushrooms, tamari and dusty Indian spices. Super-complex, it changes with every sip, and should change interestingly over the next six years. The vineyard is in the Petaluma Gap, and argues strongly for that region's future."
193079,Pinot Noir,Lynmar 2007 Five Sisters Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),US,100,97,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/lynmar-2007-five-sisters-pinot-noir-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"This important Pinot Noir is expensive, but it is absolutely worth a search. It's not a single-vineyard wine, but a blend of various blocks from the cooler southern part of the valley. Oak, to the tune of 70% new, is very strong in char and vanilla, but way stronger is the fruit itself, which is exemplary and stunning. Raspberries, cherries and strawberries just begin to describe it, with all sorts of spice and earth complexities. Stuns with purity, complexity and sheer delicious power. Great now, and will easily develop over the next 6–8 years."
193074,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt 2007 Vyborny Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),US,70,95,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/goldschmidt-2007-vyborny-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-sonoma-alexander-valley/,"A tremendous Cabernet, pure and refined, and undoubtedly the beneficiary of its great vintage. It's dry and elegant, with the slightly herbal tinge and soft tannins that Alexander Valley invariably lends. Yet the flavor profile is dominated by delicious, oak-inspired blackberries, cherries and currants. Brilliant and beautiful, and should develop for many years."
193075,Cabernet Sauvignon,Janzen 2007 Cloudy's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,100,95,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/janzen-2007-cloudys-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"A beautiful, classy Cab, marked by smoky new oak and very ripe blackberry and cassis flavors, with a streak of minerals. The vineyard is in the Vaca Mountains, in the valley's far east. You can taste the sunshine in the wonderful fruitiness, and the tannins are extraordinarily refined, but they're also aggressive. Fine now, with a long decant, but should develop bottle complexity over many years."
193076,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stonestreet 2006 Christopher's Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),US,100,96,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/stonestreet-2006-christophers-cabernet-sauvignon-sonoma-alexander-valley/,"Hard mountain tannins characterize this Cab, which was grown above 2,000 feet in the Mayacamas. It's hugely deep in blackberries and black currants, with notes of dark chocolate and violets. Meanwhile, 100% new French oak adds an elaborate layer of smoky caramel and char that's entirely in keeping with the wine's volume. Impressive and flashy, but immature, this wine requires cellaring. Best 2012–2018."
193077,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Legacy 2006 Red (Alexander Valley),US,75,96,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/legacy-2006-red-sonoma-alexander-valley/,"Hard to exaggerate the beauty of this mountain-grown wine, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon but contains the other four classic Bordeaux varieties. Although it's very tannic, those tannins are remarkably soft. Nearly all-new oak provides a framework of smoky caramel, delicious enough, but just an accompaniment to the blackberries, black currants, cherries and dark chocolate. A fantastic wine for drinking now, and should last for many years in the cellar."
193078,Cabernet Sauvignon,Quilceda Creek 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),US,125,96,2007,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/quilceda-creek-2007-cabernet-sauvignon-columbia-valley-wa/,"This feels slightly softer in the mouth than the massive 2006, but carries the density and gravitas that one associates with Quilceda Creek. Wonderful balance, with a deeply detailed set of flavors that gather strength as they move through the palate. Mixed berries, threaded with chocolate, lingering with black cherry, cassis, smoke, cedar, lead pencil and more."

Rich, sweet and concentrated, with a definite spicy character and sweet, soft tannins. This is richer than many Pétrus in the past, textured like velvet, but with final acidity."

Here the fruit seems more subdued, the wine tight, the dense tannins showing graphite and mineral more than new barrel flavors. It definitely needs decanting."
194132,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Lafite Rothschild 2009 Barrel sample  (Pauillac),France,NULL,96,2009,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-lafite-rothschild-2009-barrel-sample-red-pauillac/,"95-97 Barrel sample.

It's extremely dense, with deep and intense raspberry and cassis fruit flavor, augmented with coffee grounds, smoke and iron filings. Complex, detailed, balanced and deep—what more can a wine give you? This is drinking very young and surely needs to be decanted. But already displaying amazing power."
194140,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Pichon Longueville 2009 Barrel sample  (Pauillac),France,NULL,96,2009,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-pichon-longueville-2009-barrel-sample-red-pauillac/,"95-97 Barrel sample.

A very solid wine, showing tight wood, plum skins, power. It is much richer than usual at Haut-Brion and this gives a chunky character, the fruit a part of the very tannic structure. The aftertaste is firm, dry."
194144,Red Blend,Andrew Will 2007 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),US,53,96,2007,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/andrew-will-2007-ciel-cheval-vineyard-red-wine-columbia-valley-red-mountain/,"A completely different blend from the winery's 2006 Ciel, this reflects Chris Camarda's growing enchantment with Cabernet Franc, which is now 45% of the blend. Most of the rest is Merlot—a Right Bank style. The concept works. It captures the sleek minerality of the site, and puts the fruit into tight, laser-like focus. The wine seems almost crystalline—sharp-edged and reflective, with penetrating angles and offset flavors."
194145,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Clos Fourtet 2009 Barrel sample  (Saint-Émilion),France,NULL,96,2009,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/clos-fourtet-2009-barrel-sample-red-saint-emilion/,"95-97 Barrel sample. Black, dense fruits, licorice and dark chocolate over prunes and ripe figs. This is a spicy wine, with the acidity of the fruit forming a great balancing counterweight. Very complete."

The 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc blend shows perfect ripeness with flavors of rock and acid preserved. This wine has it all—depth, blue and purple fruits, polished tannins—and probably a 25-year lifespan."

A deep, intense take on Merlot, it's so dark and concentrated that it dances on the )edge of bitterness, but in a style reminiscent of the finest Italian Merlots, that use that flavor to define and elucidate a dark and potent wine. In the mouth it fills out with luscious cherry and plum and blackberry fruit, baking chocolate, coconut and nougat. Yet it remains sleek and stylish, with a strong licorice note."

Defines the modern Napa style in the perfectly ripe black currant and blackberry fruit, and the ultra-refined tannins. Hard to exaggerate the depth and length, the sheer opulence of this 100% Cab. It was aged in 80% new French oak, which adds even richer notes of wood smoke and sweet vanilla. Should evolve slowly through 2020, but only 75 cases were produced."

It's light years away from the Leonetti's of the 1980s—compact and loaded with black fruits, pepper, fresh herbs, rock, earth, toast and smoke. It's so tight that it's almost impossible to dissect. It needs time—a lot of time."

Brilliantly crisp in acidity, with a clean, bracing mouthfeel, it offers dazzlingly rich flavors of raspberries, cherries, orange zest, Dr. Pepper cola and Asian spices, with smoky oak adding elaborate tiers of vanilla char.

There is great intensity, but an edge of Portiness from the super-rich fruit."

Blending 77% Syrah with 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, it strikes a perfect balance among fruit, earth, and rock. At its core it is still wrapped tight, immaculately clean, and still almost impenetrably dense."

Start with earth, seaweed, compost; bring in ripe berry fruit, vanilla, tobacco. That is the nose. In the mouth you get perfect fruit—bright, tangy, a mix of berries and cherries and cassis—highlighted with sharp, defining acidity and polished tannins. Young and assertive, this needs more bottle age to show its best."

This is a delicious wine that you will enjoy on every level. The intensity and purity of the fruit and spice aromas are impressive and the mouthfeel is extra-plush and supple. Yet, those firm tannins give it the balance and structure it needs."

The wood contributes layers of toast and caramel, while the underlying wine is massive, with tiers of blackberries, black cherries, black currants, red currants, cedar and spices. Very dramatic and beautiful, but needs time. 2012–2020, at least."

Thick and tannic, yet perfectly ripe and almost silky, it coats the palate with black cherry, graphite, slate and a bit of chalk. All that said, the fruit more than holds its own against the terroir's minerality. Drink this with your best steak, and give it plenty of breathing time."

The vines are said to be over 100 years of age. Just superb. Has the balance and depth of a fine Cabernet Sauvignon, but with Zin's spicy, briary, brambly personality. Erupts in wild berry, currant, cola, leather, mocha and peppery spice flavors that are so rich and deep and long-lasting. Pricey, but sets a benchmark for Zinfandel. Only 550 cases were produced."

But you want to cellar it, because it's all primary fruit, unintegrated oak and tannins now. Beyond the sweet cedar application you'll find deep, noble flavors of black currants and minerals, wrapped into the finest tannins imaginable. Hold until 2013,at least, and should provide good drinking for many years."

Black in color and bone dry, it explodes in concentrated blackberry, blueberry, cassis, mocha, pepper and sandalwood flavors, but even more impressive is the tannic structure: so soft, intricate and silky. Wonderful with spicy pork and beef dishes."

Made solidly in the modern style, it's soft, elaborate and flamboyant, suggesting ultraripe blackberry pie, currant, mocha-choca and sweet oak flavors. The all-important tannins are smooth as velvet. Few Cabs are more delicious for drinking now, but longterm prospects are entirely unpredictable."

Drenched in all new French oak, it's elaborate in spicy, charred wood and vanillins, but the underlying wine easily supports that weight. It's flamboyant in blackberries, cherries, chocolate, red licorice and cola. The alcohol seems high, but that's in the modern style, and there's no denying the sheer lusciousness."

The feel is as lush and rich as they come, and there's outstanding purity to the lusty black fruit flavors. A masher with elegance. Maybe the best Malbec Argentina has ever produced. Drink from 2011–15."

The finish is dry but with a tinge of sweetness, like an infused blackberry liqueur, which probably is the result of high (15.3%) alcohol. Very rich and layered, and a great addition to the Napa cult pantheon. Cabernet, with Cab Franc and Petit Verdot."
195751,Cabernet Sauvignon,Krutz 2006 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,70,97,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/krutz-2006-stagecoach-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"This is really a spectacular wine. It's hard to say why it's so superior to Krutz's 2005 bottling, but it's richer and more elegant in every respect. Combines immense power with great finesse. The refined essence of blackberries, black currants and spices thrills the palate, accented with the most beautiful coating of smoky oak. A great achievement that should develop in the bottle through 2018."

The underlying fruit is spectacular, offering tiers of blackberries, black currants and cocoa, while 100% new French oak aging lends strong, but balanced, layers of toast. The tannins are ripe and sturdy, yet very finely ground. Really a beautiful example of the modern style, and should develop over the next six years."

The palate is saturated, pure, tannic and loaded with blasting berry fruit, licorice and more. Let it age for at least another year or two (maybe more). Then let it rip with a porterhouse steak."

It's lush, perfectly ripe and full of cola, black fruit and intensity. There's nary a chink in its fiber, and the rush of fruit that hits the palate followed by layers of subtleties is impressive. Great with grilled meat; drink now through 2015."

In fact, it's their best Zinfandel ever, and one that defines Sonoma County cool-climate Zinfandel. It's brilliant in balance and structure, with beautifully sculpted tannins and fine acidity, and just the right touch of oak. Within that package are savory flavors of wild blackberries, picked at their peak under the summer sun. So easy to drink, yet so complex."

Very beautiful are the tannins, which are rich and pure, suggesting perfect ripeness. The small Bosché bottling has been a premier one for the winery for many years, and this '05 is one of the best in memory. Should age effortlessly for at least a dozen years."

Brilliant winemaking that takes all the elements of great Oregon fruit and puts them into unique focus, with winemaker Kelley Fox's trademark blend of biodynamic earthy/fungal flavors, elegant berry/cherry fruit, and just a touch of milk chocolate. The alcohol just reaches 13%."

The '07 is notable for its superb structure. It has pristine tannins and a good, dry mouthfeel, with very rich flavors of blackberries, currants, chocolate and cedar that are grounded with notes of anise and sweet herbs. Very fine and dramatic, this 100% Cab should develop for at least the next eight years."

But the wine is also very tannic, giving a dry astringency through the finish. Should reward time in the cellar. Best 2012–2018."
196537,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Quintessa 2007 Red Wine Red (Rutherford),US,140,95,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/quintessa-2007-red-wine-napa-rutherford/,"A very fine Cab from the estate, which is in the north-central part of the Rutherford appellation. Judging from the tannins, it's too youthful to drink now, with a tight, astringent mouthfeel and fleshy, unintegrated oak. But the flavors are extraordinary. They flood the mouth with the essence of Cabernet, with ripe blackberries, black currants, raspberries and mocha, and the spicy finish lasts for a full minute. Give it until 2013, and it should provide great drinking through 2019, at least."
196538,Cabernet Sauvignon,Peju 2006 H.B. Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),US,225,95,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/peju-2006-hb-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-rutherford/,"This is a very high-class Cabernet. You can tell from the sumptuous tannins and the overall balance and elegance. It's soft and gentle enough to drink now, with voluptuous waves of blackberries, black currants, anise, chocolate and cedar, yet shows a density that suggests midterm ageability through 2015 or so."
196539,Pinot Noir,Failla 2008 Pearlessence Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),US,40,95,2008,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/failla-2008-pearlessence-pinot-noir-sonoma-coast/,"A terrific Pinot Noir that's so delicious, you can't stop drinking it, and also shows a wonderful, classic coastal complexity. With tangy acidity and ultrarefined tannins, it gives the essence of wild raspberries and cherries. There's a feral quality to the fruit; you can detect notes of mountain eucalyptus, fennel and lavender. Oak adds the perfect touch of smoke. Just lovely, now and through 2014."
196541,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kendall-Jackson 2007 Highlands Estates Trace Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon (Knights Valley),US,70,96,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/kendall-jackson-2007-highlands-estates-trace-ridge-cabernet-sauvignon-sonoma-knights-valley/,"Superb, opulent, just wonderful. Hard to exaggerate the beauty of this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. Fantastically ripe and rich in black cherries, currants, sandalwood and spices, with a grounding streak of herbs. Beyond the flavors is the near-perfect structure, marked by smooth, complex tannins. Finishes sweet but completely dry, the paradox of a great wine. Drink now–2015."
196542,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Kendall-Jackson 2005 Stature Red (Napa Valley),US,120,96,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/kendall-jackson-2005-stature-red-napa-valley/,"Filled with black and red berries and stone fruits that have a smoky, grilled edge, this dramatic Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend hails from several great vineyards, mainly Stagecoach, which is up on Atlas Peak. It drinks well now at the age of four-plus years, showing lush fruit that's just beginning to dry out and achieve bottle bouquet. Feels sweet and soft in the mouth. A compelling, complex and nuanced wine of great elegance and allure."
196543,Tinto del Pais,Emilio Moro 2006 Malleolus de Sanchomartin  (Ribera del Duero),Spain,204,96,2006,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/emilio-moro-2006-malleolus-sanchomartin-tempranillo-tinto-pais-ribera-duero/,"Talk about magnetic aromas of bacon, tobacco and bold black fruit, and then comes an oak-rich palate full of coconut, butter, chocolate and exotic berry flavor. Chocolate truffle and pastry work the finish, and overall this is a mile-deep beauty to drink from 2011 through 2017."
196544,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards 2007 Meredith Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),US,54,97,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/merry-edwards-2007-meredith-estate-pinot-noir-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"A splendid, near-perfect Pinot, although it's very young and will benefit from time in the bottle. Few Pinots offer richer, more massive flavors. Just explodes on the palate with raspberries, cherries, persimmons, Dr. Pepper cola, mocha and cinnamon spices, yet the tannin-acid structure keeps it all balanced. A joy to drink as it warms and changes in the glass. Now–2014."
196546,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro 2006 Malleolus de Valderramiro  (Ribera del Duero),Spain,180,97,2006,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/emilio-moro-2006-malleolus-valderramiro-tempranillo-tinto-fino-ribera-duero/,"Beautifully composed, with power and just as much precision and pizzazz. The nose offers lightly baked berry fruit notes, leather and spice, while the palate is loaded with tobacco, exotic spices and the finest natural berry flavors Spain has to offer. Smooth, elegant, finessed and potent, with integrated tannins and bold acidity that will keep it going for at least a decade. Drink from 2012 through 2018."
197818,Zinfandel,Zichichi Family Vineyard 2007 Old Vine Estate Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),US,36,95,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/zichichi-family-vineyard-2007-old-vine-estate-zinfandel-sonoma-dry-creek-valley/,"An impressive Zinfandel, notable for its complexity and charm. Exudes quintessential Zin character, with a mouthburst of red currants, black raspberry pie filling, wild cherries, sweet charred oak and masses of freshly crushed black pepper. There's even a chocolaty richness in the finish. Production of 921 cases is decent in the old-vine Zin category."
197680,Cabernet Franc,Sineann 2008 Champoux Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),US,40,95,2008,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/sineann-2008-champoux-vineyard-cabernet-franc-columbia-valley-wa/,"Certainly the finest Champoux vineyard Cabernet Franc yet from Sineann, this immense, concentrated wine blends a riot of dark fruits with baking spices, ground coffee, tobacco and caramel. Great concentration and depth, but drinking it now is robbing the cradle."
197819,Zinfandel,V. Sattui 2007 Crow Ridge Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),US,33,95,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/v-sattui-2007-crow-ridge-vineyard-zinfandel-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"This is great Zinfandel. The vineyard was planted in 1915 and probably contains other varieties than Zinfandel. Yields are extraordinarily low, as they are in these coastal ancient vineyards. The wine's concentration is impressive, spanning ripe, crushed raspberries through cherry pie filling to black currants, with all sorts of earthy, minerally, balsam and cedar complexities, not to mention the masses of spice. Has the balance of a fine Cabernet Sauvignon, with smooth tannins and fine acidity. Zinfandel hardly gets any better than this."
197820,Syrah,Terre Rouge 2007 Ascent Syrah (Sierra Foothills),US,85,95,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/terre-rouge-2007-ascent-shiraz-syrah-syrah-sierra-foothills/,"This is one of the few California Syrahs that demands time in the cellar. Its tough tannins form an aloof astringency that makes it virtually undrinkable now, but it has an incredible core of blackberry, black currant and dark chocolate fruit. Peppery, anise, leather and spice notes, in addition to slightly caramelized vanillins from 100% new oak, impart great complexity. Best 2012 and beyond."
198796,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lail 2006 J. Daniel Cuvée Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,125,95,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/lail-2006-j-daniel-cuvee-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"Lush, rich, beguiling now. Tastes fat and unctuous, like a Pomerol despite being made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, offering a creamy wealth of cherries, currants, chocolate, anise, herbs, spices and smoky oak. For all the flamboyance, it's bone dry, with classically solid Napa tannins, courtesy of fruit from Oakville and Howell Mountain. Should develop in the bottle through 2018."
198540,Red Blend,Stolpman 2007 La Croce Red (Santa Ynez Valley),US,66,96,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/stolpman-2007-croce-red-central-coast-santa-ynez-valley/,"This is the costliest of Stolpman's new reds and easily the best. It impresses for the depth of flavor and classic, dense structure. A co-fermented blend of Sangiovese and Syrah, it shows imposingly complex layers of dark stone fruits and berries, dark chocolate, bacon, dusty Indian spices and sweet, smoky sandalwood, wrapped into powerfully rich but gently ground tannins. Very fine, approaching the profound. Now–2013 before it loses freshness."
198788,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Cos d'Estournel 2007  Saint-Estèphe,France,120,95,2007,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-cos-destournel-2007-red-saint-estephe/,"With its perfumed aromas, this is a wine that has richness and sweetness, with soft velvet power. It has an intense wood element that needs to blend into the rest of the wine, but the sweet black currant and freshness provide a good balance. This is a seductive wine, with a fine solid character."
198789,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Mouton Rothschild 2007  Pauillac,France,450,95,2007,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-mouton-rothschild-2007-red-pauillac/,"The wood element is important here, but it is based on a firm Cabernet Sauvignon structure, dry but rich tannins. The wine is a great success for the vintage, giving sweetness, ripe fruit that only shows light extraction, and dark plum and berry flavors. The feeling is of polished fruit and wood, rounded but always dense."
198790,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Latour 2007  Pauillac,France,500,95,2007,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-latour-2007-red-pauillac/,"A big and powerful wine, with tannins that are compact and dense. The dryness of the tannins go right to the core, surrounded by chocolate, sweet fruit and dark berry flavors. The wine is well structured, big and bold, with plenty of firmness promising aging."
198791,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Ausone 2007  Saint-Émilion,France,850,95,2007,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-ausone-2007-red-saint-emilion/,"While there is certainly plenty of wood here, the wine has weight and impressive concentration for the year. The tannins are still brooding away, giving a dark firm character to the wine. Blackberry fruits and acidity are there, but still well buried in the tannins."
198793,Pinot Noir,Semper 2007 Ellenbach Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),US,85,95,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/semper-2007-ellenbach-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-coast/,"Acidity makes the mouth water, tannins provide a firm framework, oak is perfectly integrated, and the depth of fruit is impressive. Shows flavors of cherry tart, raspberry Newton, cola, buttered cinnamon toast and vanilla that are magnificent and decadent. Elegant and classy. Should negotiate the years through 2014."
198794,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vinifera 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,40,95,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/vinifera-2006-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"Here's a young, vital, impressive 100% Cabernet. It's dry, full-bodied and rich in classic flavors of blackberries, black currants, graphite and minerals, wrapped into silky tannins. Superb oak integration lends notes of vanilla and sandalwood. Just gorgeous in the mouth, filled with class and elegance. Now–2014, at least."
198807,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trefethen 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Oak Knoll District),US,100,99,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/trefethen-2005-reserve-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-oak-knoll-district/,"This is nearly perfect, a massive, monumental wine whose sheer power is matched only by its grace and refinement. The flavors of blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, buttered toast and cedar flood the mouth, tightly controlled by firm tannins and good acidity. Decant for several hours if you open it now, but better to give it 6–10 years in the bottle."
198797,Pinot Noir,Hartford 2007 Seascape Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),US,65,95,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/hartford-2007-seascape-pinot-noir-sonoma-coast/,"The Jackson and Hartford families established this vineyard on the far Sonoma Coast in hopes of crafting Pinot Noir at the limits of its ability to ripen. The magnificent 2007 vintage has resulted in a wine of unusual tension. It's very ripe in black and red cherry pie filling and sweet oak flavors, but retains the acidity of its cool-climate origins, and even offers a feral taste of bloody meat. Drink this impressive, complex wine now and through 2015."
198798,Red Blend,Dominio de Atauta 2006  Ribera del Duero,Spain,50,95,2006,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/dominio-atauta-2006-red-ribera-duero/,"What a beauty! Masculine aromas of black fruits, cola and oak sit there begging to be sipped, while the lush, deep palate is home to dense blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. Lively but dense, with tannins, plenty of oak and a finish of black pepper, fudge and vanilla. Complex and exciting Spanish wine. Needs time; best from 2012 through 2018."
198800,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hestan 2006 Stephanie Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,50,96,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/hestan-2006-stephanie-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"Classic and harmonious, a very solid Napa 100% Cabernet that's dry and firmly tannic in the mouth. Feels balanced, harmonious, ageworthy, a wine without seams or faults. Fruity, but not overly so, with the blackberries and black currants generously balanced by herbs, minerals and cedar. Very classic and noble wine, and one to cellar through at least 2018."
198801,Tempranillo Blend,Remírez de Ganuza 2005 Old Vines Unfiltered  (Rioja),Spain,82,96,2005,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/remirez-ganuza-2005-old-vines-unfiltered-tempranillo-blend-rioja/,"Concentrated to the hilt, with molten black fruit, coconut and mint aromas. The palate is driven, tannic, pure and features dynamite flavors of black fruit, bitter chocolate and spice cake. So beautiful and big, but also showing elegance and restraint. Drinkable now but will age well for another seven years or more."
198802,Cabernet Sauvignon,Redmon 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),US,65,97,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/redmon-2006-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-st-helena/,"Monumentally detailed, this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is impressive for its sheer volumetrics. Offers masses of blackberries, black currants, cherries and cassis.  Huge, dramatic, yet impeccably balanced and dry. Feels firm and ultrarefined in tannic structure, with graceful acidity offering a perfect counterpoint to the fruity richness. Just beautiful, and ageable for at least a decade."
198803,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hestan 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,100,97,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/hestan-2006-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"Massive, dramatic, beautiful, intense, but young and firm in tannins, with a cut of fresh acidity. Shows concentrated blackberries, black currants, violets, minerals and cedar, leading to a long, penetrating finish. Very great Cabernet, vibrant and potent, just tremendous in structure. Potentially a near-perfect wine with 4–6 years in the bottle."
198804,Pinot Noir,Semper 2007 Gold Ridge Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),US,85,97,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/semper-2007-gold-ridge-pinot-noir-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"An extraordinary wine. It's the essence of Russian River Pinot, squared, a big, concentrated, dramatic wine that never loses sight of elegance. Offers a tapestry of cherry pie with the crust, red currant, cherry liqueur and smoky sandalwood flavors that finish with intricate Indian spices. Drink now–2013."
198805,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trefethen 2005 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Oak Knoll District),US,50,97,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/trefethen-2005-estate-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-oak-knoll-district/,"A monumental Cabernet that succeeds on every level. It's deep, dark and ultrarich, showing massive blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate, violets, minerals and a touch of sweet, smoky oak. Beyond the flavors is the dramatic structure, with fabulously ripe, dense tannins and a bone-dry, long finish. Surely a tremendous wine capable of long-term aging. Try 2012–2018, at least."
199678,Cabernet Sauvignon,Freemark Abbey 2004 Sycamore Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),US,70,95,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/freemark-abbey-2004-sycamore-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-rutherford/,"A real success story for this hot vintage. Feels gracious and generous in the mouth, offering complex, fat flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, mocha and cedar that turn spicy on the finish. The tannins are elaborately ripe and fine. The well-known vineyard is on the Rutherford bench, and production was 2,300 cases. Drinkable now, and should age well for at least a decade."
199679,Merlot,Fattoria Petrolo 2006 Galatrona Merlot (Toscana),Italy,120,95,2006,Tuscany,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/fattoria-petrolo-2006-galatrona-merlot-toscana/,"With its extraordinary texture, bright personality and complex medley of aromas, this is a lovely Merlot. The aromatic layers here include red cherry, earthy tones, exotic spice and cinnamon. The mouthfeel is smooth and gorgeous with delicious softness and opulent richness. Drink after 2015."

It's extraordinarily deeply flavored, offering waves of wild cherries, cola, anise, molé sauce, pepper spice and sandalwood, wrapped into profoundly fine tannins, and with a long, dry finish. Drink this near-perfect Zinfandel over the next six years."
199675,Pinot Noir,Sea Smoke 2007 Southing Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),US,50,95,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/sea-smoke-2007-southing-pinot-noir-central-coast-sta-rita-hills/,"A fabulously rich and approachable Pinot Noir that offers everything now, yet will also age. The considerable tannins will protect it in the cellar for a good 6–8 years, but it's so fresh and vibrant in cherries, red currants and oak-inspired red licorice that it's hard not to drink it now. Hard to exaggerate the deliciousness factor."
199676,Pinot Noir,Paul Lato 2007 Fiddlestix Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),US,70,95,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/paul-lato-2007-fiddlestix-vineyard-pinot-noir-central-coast-sta-rita-hills/,"A spectacular Pinot Noir, but you don't want to open it anytime soon. Shows the pedigree of this vineyard, a superbly balanced wine rich in acidity and minerals. The fruit? Black and red cherries, blackberries, cola, cocoa powder and red currants, enriched with smoky cedarwood. Beautiful, but needs time. The window is 2011–2013."
199689,Red Blend,Tenuta dell'Ornellaia 2006 Ornellaia  (Bolgheri Superiore),Italy,200,97,2006,Tuscany,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/tenuta-dellornellaia-2006-ornellaia-red-bolgheri-superiore/,"Consistently among Italy's top-scoring wines, this vintage of the celebrated Ornellaia (a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot) is a gorgeous expression of the very best of European enology. It delivers extraordinary richness, succulence and intensity, but remains elegant to the end. Aromas include black cherry, spice and dark chocolate."
199681,Malbec,Château du Cèdre 2006 Le Cèdre Malbec (Cahors),France,60,95,2006,Southwest France,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-cedre-2006-le-malbec-cahors/,"Almost black in color, this is a wonderful wine with a long development ahead. At the moment, wood is still too dominant, but just taste the weight of the darkest plum and sweet fig fruit flavors, a line of licorice and bitter coffee and huge, dry tannins."
199690,Pinot Noir,Sea Smoke 2007 Ten Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),US,80,97,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/sea-smoke-2007-ten-pinot-noir-central-coast-sta-rita-hills/,"This very dense, tannic Pinot Noir represents a triumph for both the winery, the vintage and the region it represents. A multi-clone blend (hence the name) with high, cool-climate acidity and aged in 100% new oak, it's still young, fresh and tight. The astringency throws a cloak over the raspberries, cherries, rosehip tea and Indian spice flavors, which reveal themselves only reluctantly. But they're there, in an imposing texture of velvet and silk. This enormous wine demands time. The window seems to be 2012–2015."
199691,Cabernet Sauvignon,Napa Angel 2006 by Montes Aurelio's Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,90,97,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/napa-angel-2006-by-montes-aurelios-selection-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"From Chilean winemaker, Aurelio Montes, this 100% Cabernet shows massively concentrated flavors of ripe blackberries and cassis, with richer notes of dark chocolate, anise, spices and smoky cedar. What an amazing tannin structure, intricate, fine and complex. A wine to drink now for sheer opulence or to age for at least a dozen years."
199692,Red Blend,Marchesi Antinori 2006 Guado al Tasso  (Bolgheri Superiore),Italy,95,97,2006,Tuscany,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/marchesi-antinori-2006-guado-al-tasso-red-bolgheri-superiore/,"Guado al Tasso is finally back. After a string of past vintages that exhibited some rubber-like aromas, the 2006 expression is a study in purity, focus and excellence. This wine is impressive on all levels in terms of intensity, personality and persistency. It's rich and luscious with smooth tannins and lasting flavors of blackberry and spice. Drink after 2015."
199693,Cabernet Sauvignon,Quilceda Creek 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),US,125,98,2006,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/quilceda-creek-2006-cabernet-sauvignon-columbia-valley-wa/,"The 2006 flagship Cabernet from Quilceda Creek is a massive wine that has just begun to emerge from its slumber. When first released the wine seemed to have entered a dumb phase, but six months later it responds to decanting and shows its muscle. Fruit flavors of black, brandied cherries, cassis and bourbon-soaked plums are wrapped in generous, layered oak. The wine is dusty, smoky, laced with streaks of licorice and brightened with sharp acids. It continues to expand further in the glass, adding flesh and spice to its frame, with a cedar/cigar box finish."
199694,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cardinale 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,200,100,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/cardinale-2006-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"Tasted in a flight of great and famous Napa wines, this Cardinale stood at the head of the pack. Starts with a very fine nose of cedar, cassis, ripe blackberries and violets, then turns dramatic and refined in the mouth. Shows vast depth and length, with the finish a full minute of sweet fruits and spices. Marvelous tannins, so plush and elegant, so powerful yet refined. The grapes hail from Mt. Veeder, Howell Mountain, Stags Leap and Oakville, and the blend contains 14% Merlot. As good as it is now, it will improve for at least eight years."
199733,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,Buty 2006 Columbia Rediviva Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),US,48,96,2006,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/buty-2006-columbia-rediviva-red-blend-cabernet-sauvignon-syrah-columbia-valley-horse-heaven-hills/,"This first estate-grown bottling of Rediviva is 55% Cabernet Sauvignon and 45% Syrah. Amazing aromatic complexity grabs you and leads you into the dark interior of the wine, a riot of red and black fruits, moist earth, smoke, anise, herb and toast. Power and elegance combined, with the structure to age for a decade or more."
199683,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sabina Vineyards 2006 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),US,100,95,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/sabina-2006-estate-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-st-helena/,"To call this a big Cab would be an understatement. It's a black-colored, saturated wine that detonates on the palate, offering a blast of black and red berries, currants, cassis, dark unsweetened chocolate, anise and fine, upscale new oak. But the tannins are fierce. Very fine, among the best St. Helena Cabernets of the vintage. Needs time. 2012–2020."
199685,Pinot Noir,Bjornstad 2007 van der Kamp Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),US,40,96,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bjornstad-2007-van-der-kamp-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-mountain/,"It's hard to consistently get scores this high year after year, but Greg Bjornstad does, because he understands Pinot Noir. Specifically, he knows how to combine power, which is easy, with finesse, which isn't. This 2007, from an esteemed vineyard, is spectacular in wild forest cherry, cola, licorice, pine cone, anise, exotic spice and sandalwood flavors, even as it's perfectly balanced with crisp acidity, fine tannins and just-right oak. Lovely and complex. Now–2014."
199686,Pinot Noir,Bjornstad 2007 Hellenthal Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),US,40,96,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bjornstad-2007-hellenthal-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-coast/,"There's a wildland, coastal mountain taste to this wine, which brims with bone-dry, exotic, woodsy tastes of wild forest cherries, fennel, balsam, cola, volcanic minerals, raw beef and Asian spices, not to mention the sweet veneer of sandalwood. It's utterly distinct from other Pinots in its almost feral complexity, a wine that changes with every sniff and sip. Should develop through 2014. This is a great price for a Pinot Noir of this integrity and interest. Only 152 cases were produced, but it's worth the search."

Deeply aromatic, offering waves of grilled blackberries, currants, violets, sweet buttered cinnamon toast and sandalwood. The tannin structure is superb. Feels classically dense and full-bodied in the mouth, very dry, yet opulent and complex. Grows more concentrated as it airs in the glass. A tremendous wine that needs time. 2012–2020."

This is a ripe, full and rich expression of Nebbiolo with long-lasting flavors of blackberry, tar and cola."

The palate is ultra rich and modern in style, with deep, brandied flavors of cola, black cherry and spice. Driven, modern and properly tannic, with a fair amount of mocha and creaminess on the finish. Drink from late 2010 thru 2014."

Cellar the wine 10 years or more to achieve balance between its firm tannins and bright acidity. The wine already shows incredibly complex aromas of wild berry fruit, truffle and cola and those tones will surely become more elegant with time."

The La Coste Barolo is a tight and focused wine that promises to age beautifully over many more years. The tannins and acidity are perfectly integrated and the nose boasts bright and intense layers of forest fruit, exotic spice, mesquite and black licorice."

Terrific in crisp acidity and finely meshed tannins that frame ripe, rich flavors of cherry pulp, root beer, anise and oak that finish long and impressively delicious. Complex and compelling now, and will develop in the bottle over the next 6–8 years."

Thoroughly dry, it shows complex flavors of wild raspberries, cherry compote, cola and spices, compounded with smoky, sweet oak. Give it until 2011 to begin to come around."

It's vibrantly rich and forward in blackberries, black cherries, plums, dark chocolate and sweet smoky new oak, yet very tannic. Creates an astringency that lasts through the spicy finish. It would be a pity to open it before 2012, and will last for years after."

The tannins are hard, and while they're very finely ground, they prevent the palate from full appreciation of the lush blackberries, black cherries, dark chocolate and herbs.

Mauro Molino first bottled in 1985 and has shown consistent results that seem to have hit a high point this vintage. Fruit is harvested from the Vigna Conca cru, resulting in elegant and refined pulses of wild berries, cola and white almond. The wine is delicate and feminine, but delivers a blast of power and persistency on the close."

There is no interference here; just pure, big-boned, modern-style Tempranillo flavors of currants, blackberry and soft, cuddly oak. Finishes with cream and coconut, but length and power as well. Hold until late 2010 and drink through 2015."

The flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, cocoa, herbs and sweetly smoked oak are beautiful and complex, yet the tannin-acid balance is near perfect. This single-vineyard wine is one of the finest Sonoma County Cabernets of the vintage. Should age effortlessly through 2014, growing purer and more elegant."
200565,Nebbiolo,Eugenio Bocchino 2005 La Serra  (Barolo),Italy,99,96,2005,Piedmont,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/eugenio-bocchino-2005-serra-nebbiolo-barolo/,"This beautiful expression of Nebbiolo from the La Serra cru represents the best of Barolo winemaking tradition.

The wine is impeccable. Crisp in acidity, with a silky, elegant texture, it shows complex flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola, orange zest, Asian spices and earthy rhubarb. It's dry, but with a rich, fruity-oaky sweetness. Delicious and compelling, it should develop over the next 6–8 years."

Racy in acidity, silky in texture, yet powerful, it exudes the essence of Pinot Noir's greatness. Shows great fruity ripeness in the cherry, Dr. Pepper cola, licorice and bacon flavors, and also a wild, forest quality of grilled mushrooms, thyme and fennel. Absolutely dry, with a firm spine of tannins, the structure is near perfect. A divine expression of Hirsch, and a good candidate for six years in the cellar."
200568,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem 2007 Allen Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),US,78,97,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/williams-selyem-2007-allen-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"Not showing well now due to the tannins. It's dry and tough, with a resistance to the richness. Yet the core of flavor is enormous. Shows concentrated, flashy flavors of cherry marmalade, raspberry, orange blossom, cola, licorice, rose tea and spices that go on and on and continue to develop in the glass. The texture is pure silk and satin. Needs 4–6 years to develop, and could go beyond that."

The vines are the closest to the river in the famed Rochioli vineyard, and the resulting wine always has an elegant structure and fruity accessibility that make it drinkable at a younger age. Showing rich flavors of cherries, red currants, cola, bacon, anise, Asian spices and smoky oak, it will develop beautifully over the next decade."
200572,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem 2007 Precious Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),US,90,98,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/williams-selyem-2007-precious-mountain-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-coast/,"Ripe and delicious right out of the bottle, although it will age well. Made from a vineyard on the true Sonoma Coast, in the remote Fort Ross area, it's fabulously rich in cherry, framboise and red currant flavors, with intriguing waves of anise, bacon and sweet, vanilla-scented smoky sandalwood. There's a foresty taste, too, suggesting dried pine needles. The tannins and acids are near perfect. Stunning now, and should hold for at least six years."
200573,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem 2007 Litton Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),US,100,100,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/williams-selyem-2007-litton-estate-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"A spectacular Pinot Noir, but a very young one, and extremely dry. It's a wine of great structure, with rich acids and tannins framing extraordinarily complex flavors of grilled cherries, strawberries and raspberries, with complicating notes of cola, pomegranates, orange zest, anise, dusty Asian spices and smoky sandalwood. A truly great Pinot Noir from a great vintage that needs time in the bottle to express itself. The vineyard, which is owned by the winery, is only 19 acres, planted to an array of newer and older clones. Best after 2013, if you can keep your hands off."

Erupts in the most complex blackberries, black currants, licorice and 100% new smoky oak flavors, with a spicy finish that goes on and on. The tannins are strong and fine and impressive. Not for the faint-hearted, and not a wine to drink now, as it will swamp food. Should begin to emerge after 2012."
200549,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Blackbird Vineyards 2007 Paramour Red (Napa Valley),US,90,95,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/blackbird-2007-paramour-red-napa-valley/,"Some wines are meant for immediate consumption. Others require age. This wonderful wine satisfies on both sides. It's softly rich and polished in tannins, with accessible blackberry, cassis and oak flavors. Yet it has the structure and depth to go for years. Now–2016, at least."

This one, from Howell Mountain, shows the density and power that typify all his wines. Although it's thoroughly dry, it tastes almost sweet in grilled blackberry marmalade flavors, balanced with good acidity and wonderfully fine tannins. Feels like it has the capacity to age for decades."
201310,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hanna 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),US,52,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/hanna-2005-reserve-cabernet-sauvignon-sonoma-alexander-valley/,"Grown in the flatlands and benches of Alexander Valley, this Cab tastes more like a high mountain wine, with its firm tannins and flavor intensity. It's quite fine, showing intense blackberry, cherry, black currant, plum, cocoa and violet flavors that are tinged with soft, dry herbs. Very beautiful now for sheer charm, it will develop bottle complexities over the next decade. The best Cabernet from Hanna in memory."
201067,Pinot Noir,Failla 2006 Vivien Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),US,70,97,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/failla-2006-vivien-pinot-noir-sonoma-coast/,"This small- production wine showcases the wild, feral and lonely personality of this winery's extreme coastal mountain location, offering the most exotic flavors that are hard to describe. Asian pears, pomegranates, Dr. Pepper cola, red currants, licorice, bacon and rare berries like mulberries and loganberries come to mind. It's softly delicious and drinkable now, yet has a firm acidic structure that suggests aging into the future. It will be fascinating to watch this wine develop over the next decade."

While there is a surprising amount of wood here, the fruit gives a great ripe swathe of blackberry and red plum flavors. The wood spice goes with an impressive weight of fruit, shining through a lovely, perfumed aftertaste."

The tannic structure is enormous, providing a sandpapery dryness to the palate. Yet the flavor explosion is so powerful, you can enjoy it now with utter satisfaction. Erupts in grilled blackberry and cherry, Dr. Pepper cola, bacon, anise, sautéed wild mushroom and smoky sandalwood flavors, leading to a spicy finish that continues for a full minute. Glorious and decadent. The winemaker was Sashi Moorman, from Stolpman, and the vineyard was planted in 1994 to the Calera clone. Only 115 cases were produced. Drink now–2017."

Meanwhile, new oak adds lush layers of smoke, woodspice and buttered toast. The result is a tough young wine that needs time, and possibly lots. Don't think of opening it before 2011, and it should develop for many more years. Potentially great."

The concentration of cassis and black cherry fruit is astonishing, matched with ripe tannins that hint at black olive. Despite the somewhat heavier oak influence, it is the fruit that stands front and center."

Showcases Russian River/Sonoma Coast Pinot at its finest, with superb acidity, ultra-refined tannins and flavors of grilled blackberries, cherry pie filling, cola, crushed black pepper, cinnamon, anise and smoky, caramelized sandalwood. As rich as it is, there's an elusive quality, with hints of wild game and undefineable forest floor. Beautiful now and through 2015."

It's explosive in flavor, offering a mouthblast of peppery blackberries, roasted meat, red licorice, pomegranates and smoky cedar. There are even suggestions of dark chocolate, cassis and minerals as well as sweetness, although it's absolutely dry. It has the most beautiful tannin-acid balance that launches it into classic territory. This superlative Syrah, among the greatest in California, should hit its stride after 2010."

It needs time to knit together and mellow. But such is the balance of all the parts that it should easily negotiate through at least 2015, when the cherries, berries, cola, bacon, earth, exotic spices and sweet oak should meld. An exciting, promising Pinot Noir."

Almost a meal in itself, this is a fruity, but definitely chewy wine."

It's a big wine with sizable tannins and crisp, coastal acidity, but it's very dry and silky, and shows great elegance. Should develop bottle complexity over the next six years."

It's tightly wound and immature, offering a blast of primary fruit flavors that haven't yet integrated with the oak. It tastes almost sweet now, although it's technically bone dry, with waves of black cherries, blackberries, mocha, anise liqueur and smoky oak vanillins, followed by a long, spicy finish. Hold until 2012, if you can, and should drink well beyond that."
201597,Pinot Noir,Adelsheim 2007 Winderlea Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),US,75,96,2007,Oregon,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/adelsheim-2007-winderlea-vineyard-pinot-noir-willamette-valley-dundee-hills/,"This vineyard is a magical site, one of the greatest Oregon Pinot vineyards.

Initially, the wine seems austere, very mineral. It opens slowly, showing fruit that is definitely rich, offering velvet tannins. But there is also an iron hand in that velvet glove, because the structure then comes bursting through."

Dense and full-bodied, it shows flashy flavors of black and red berries, currants, cola, pomegranates and dusty spices, enhanced with the most perfect application of smoky oak and wrapped into a rich, silky texture. The balance is exquisite, a tension of acidity and tannins. Beautiful now, and should develop bottle complexity for at least six years."

The wine has pinpoint focus, bright fruit, natural layering of spice, fruit and herb, with a punchy, briny spine that seems to gather force and go on forever.

New wood aromas, follow with solid, dark fruits. This is a powerful wine, which shows elegance and structure together and in balance. A wine for long-term aging. The wood element needs to be watched, though."

Shows the purest expression of black currants, cassis, blackberries, blueberries, chocolate and sweet, smoky sandalwood. Very classic and elegant, with great power and authority.

Yet it's perfectly ripe, showing luminous flavors of raspberries, cherries, pomegranates and sweet red plums, enriched with sweet, smoky oak. Fabulous now, and should glide easily through the next six years."

The 83% Cabernet Sauvignon is sourced from Hendry Ranch and the 17% Cabernet Franc from Detert East Vineyard, a stone's throw from To Kalon. Impressively concentrated and lengthy, within a wealth of power, it is nuanced in black cherry, leather saddle and crushed rock, with the scent of violet never far behind."

The winery, run by grandson Stéphane Ferreira, is the grandkids' tribute. This richly perfumed wine, by consultant Luis Pato, comes from a field blend of 21 grape varieties. Old vines with an average age of 82-years-old in a single parcel have given the wine huge concentration and rich swathes of tannins and black plum and damson fruit. The wine has power while also retaining plenty of elegance. It is an impressive wine, just approaching its peak and ready from 2018."

A generous wine, this boasts a powerful structure and rich texture from the fermentation in stone lagars. It's shot through with ripe black plum and damson fruits as well as ample acidity. It should age and harmonize a bit further before enjoying, so drink from 2019."

It walks a fine line between tenacious structure and high-cheekboned fruit—a mélange of raspberry, cassis and blueberry compote. The aromas are enticing and reminiscent of violets.

It's refreshingly tart and earthy on the palate, where dewy sage, mint and tarragon touches lift its youthful raspberry and green olive flavors. Easy to guzzle, yet intriguingly complex."

The aromatics are dazzling, with a lightly peppery, meaty aspect around slightly muted notes of herb and rock. The fruit is especially generous, with blackberry and boysenberry predominant. The wine is stylish, with cut and precision. Though truly exceptional, it needs your complete attention and some extra aeration to show its best."

It's an immense wine, explosive in blackberry, black currant, cedar and spice flavors, with immaculate Oakville tannins. Right up there with the best. Refined and exquisite on release, even without decanting, it will easily negotiate many years in the cellar."
216011,Cabernet Sauvignon,Inglenook 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),US,78,95,2015,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/inglenook-2015-cabernet-sauvignon-rutherford/,"This bottling reflects the past several years' fine-tuning the winery's vision in the vineyard and in the cellar. Including small amounts of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, Merlot and Malbec, it's a rounded, concentrated wine that expresses the vintage with ripe, grippy tannins that beg for further resolution. Blackberry, clove and leather flavors rise to the fore. Cellar through 2035."

Really impresses for its power and elegance, but way too young. We're entering a new era where some Pinots require cellaring and this is one of them. It's all acidity, oak and primary fruit now, but with such a nuclear concentration of cherries, raspberries and pomegranates that it will easily develop. Could be something special by 2012."
218662,Pinot Noir,Etude 2006 Heirloom Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Carneros),US,90,95,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/etude-2006-heirloom-estate-grown-pinot-noir-napa-sonoma-carneros/,"Big, powerful, soft, rich and ageable. In other words, classic Etude Heirloom. Resembles the rich 2002, with massive flavors of cherries, raspberries, cocoa, anise, bacon and smoky sandalwood. Enormously complex, a wine that changes with every sip as it breathes and warms. Shows the density of Cabernet, with Pinot's silkiness. Now–2014."

Also shows a silky, airy mouthfeel. But it's way too young now, an obvious ager, and in fact demands time in the bottle. Stash this beauty. Best 2011–2013, possibly longer."
218666,Red Blend,Tenuta delle Terre Nere 2007 Guardiola  (Etna),Italy,46,95,2007,Sicily &amp; Sardinia,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/tenuta-delle-terre-nere-2007-guardiola-red-etna/,"From what may be the most beautiful vineyard on the planet with gnarled and knotted limbs of head-trained vines that emerge from blackened volcanic soils, Guardiola is an extraordinary wine. It is elegant inside and out with penetrating aromas of licorice, violets, coal, mesquite, black currants and cassis. The tannins are polished but firm and the wine promises a long aging future ahead."

The wine is absolutely black. Aromas are concentrated and intense and the wine is equally enormous in the mouth thanks to the extraction, oak, fruit and the hot climatic conditions associated with this vintage. Drink after 2020."

In 2006 Smith has made a wine better than each of these, by combining them into a single wine—Royal City Syrah. Rich scents of purple fruit, smoked meat, cedar, lead pencil, moist earth and so on proclaim a wine with genuine gravitas. There is nothing missing, from the first sniff to the last sip, the wine delivers on all levels. Complex, beautifully balanced, powerful and detailed."
219610,Cabernet Sauvignon,St. Supéry 2005 Dollarhide Limited Edition Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,80,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/st-supery-2005-dollarhide-limited-edition-estate-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"This is an extraordinarily fine Cabernet Sauvignon, easily St. Supéry's best in memory. It's made in a completely different style from the prevailing cult model, being fully dry, lower in alcohol, and maintaining a tannic structure framing blackberry and currant flavors that are notably balanced with herbs and tobacco. Will get better and better. Call it Bordeaux-esque. Now–2017."
219611,Syrah,Owen Roe 2007 Lady Rosa Syrah (Yakima Valley),US,45,95,2007,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/owen-roe-2007-lady-rosa-shiraz-syrah-syrah-columbia-valley-yakima/,"Very impressive—dark, aromatic, totally ripe and saturated, yet retaining Syrah's delicate, floral aromatics, streaks of citrus, amplified with a stunning array of harmonic accents. The flavors waft along, powerful and refined, plush and muscular; the wine seems to gather force and length as it extends into finishing flavors of licorice, smoke and coffee."
219607,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hidden Ridge 2005 55% Slope Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),US,75,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/hidden-ridge-2005-55-slope-cabernet-sauvignon-sonoma-county/,"A very fine Cabernet that combines the modern cult style of ripeness with old-fashioned structure to produce a wine of exceptional appeal. It's rich in mountain-intense black currants, bitter chocolate, spices and smoky oak, wrapped into splendid tannins, and the finish is thoroughly dry. The grapes are from the Sonoma side of Spring Mountain, and the winemaker was veteran Marco DiGiulio. Now–2013."
219609,Pinot Noir,Drew 2007 Fog-Eater Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),US,42,95,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/drew-2007-fog-eater-pinot-noir-mendocino-lake-counties-anderson-valley/,"A stunning Pinot Noir, and a worthy followup to Drew's 2006 bottling. Interestingly, the official alcohol is nearly 1% lower at no loss of ripeness, a testimony to the success of the vintage. Offers everything you want in a fine coastal Pinot: crisp acidity, a dry, silky mouthfeel, refined tannins, complexity and ageability. The flavors include red cherries and currants, cola, sassafras, red licorice and Asian spices. Great now and through 2013."

Aromatic layers of milk chocolate, nutmeg, vanilla and Christmas spice peel back one thick layer after the next. This is a loudspeaker wine with extraordinary intensity and softness from start to finish."

It stuns with the richness of black cherries and red currants that have an edge of cocoa and pepper, yet finishes totally dry, with balancing acidity. Best of all is the authoritative mouthfeel. This gorgeous Pinot is very great now, and should evolve through 2013. Unfortunately, only 111 cases were produced."
219801,Pinot Noir,Melville 2007 Carrie's Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),US,52,97,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/melville-2007-carries-pinot-noir-central-coast-sta-rita-hills/,"Combines a delicate, floral lightness with a potent intricacy to produce a wine of vast intellectual interest. Dry and somewhat tannic, and crisp in tangy acidity, this small-production Pinot features tiers of tart red cherries, rosehip tea, cola, mint, lavender, anise and pepper, edged with the honeyed sweetness of smoky, glazed oak. A tremendous achievement, and the wine of the vintage."

The wine is soft, velvety and penetrating in the mouth with succulent flavors of blackberry, creamy cassis berry, chocolate and tobacco. Thick extraction and quality fruit craft a memorable wine that will last many long and happy years in your cellar."

Hard to exaggerate the lush, New World, cult-style power. High but balanced alcohol, massive new French oak, and a nuclear core of blackberries and currants. Somehow, it all works. A slam-dunk for aging. Drink now through 2018."

Dense and layered, it immediately seduces for its softly lush flavors of blackberries, currants, anise, chocolate and sweet smoky oak. Yet it has the tannic complexity to age through 2013 at least. Made from 100% Cab, it's a blend of their best barrels from Diamond Mountain, Stags Leap and Sonoma Mountain. Just 103 cases were produced."
221194,Pinot Noir,Joseph Drouhin 2006 Clos de Vougeot  (Clos de Vougeot),France,205,95,2006,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/joseph-drouhin-2006-clos-vougeot-pinot-noir-clos-vougeot/,"Powerful, opulent and rounded, this is a dense wine. Drouhin owns two parcels on the eastern edge of the slope of Clos de Vougeot, and the wine does show great rich swathes of plums, dry figs, chocolate and sweet jelly, balanced by firm tannins and bright, always rich acidity. An impressive wine."

His Finca Dofi blends Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon with some Syrah and sometimes Merlot, and the result is extremely impressive vintage after vintage. This wine is alluring, silky smooth and endowed with beautiful herb and mineral notes along with light oak, fine tannins and non-stop length on the finish. It's drinkable right now and should hold steady and/or improve over the next five years. Imported by Rare Wine Company. Editors' Choice."

It's absolutely delicious, offering a range of blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors, complexed with notes of chocolate, anise, sweet smoky leather and Asian spices. Beautiful now for its velvety softness, but has the inherent structure to last for a long time. Through 2014, and much longer if you like older Cabernet."
221197,Pinot Noir,Joseph Drouhin 2006  Musigny,France,380,95,2006,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/joseph-drouhin-2006-pinot-noir-musigny/,"For many, this vineyard offers the purest form of Pinot Noir, a seductive, opulent style, with rich fruits dominant, the powerful acidity deceptively sweet. Add to this a tight, firm, smoke-and-toast tannic structure, and this is not only a fine wine now, but one with long-term potential. Keep for at least six years."

It's a miracle how it manages to be so low in alcohol, yet so rich. Dusty Asian spices like nutmeg and cinnamon accentuate flavors of mashed red cherries, red currants, cola and cedar, with a tease of rosehip tea. Shows extraordinary tension. Drink now–2012."

Totally dry, with sturdy but ultra-refined tannins, it displays massive waves of blackberries, black currants, blueberries, smoked meat, violets, sandalwood and black pepper. Just beginning to find its groove, it should develop for many years."

Here are blue and black fruits, layers of smoke and bitter chocolate, yet a lifted, floral scent is also there. In the finish it feels chewy and substantial, with threads of cedar, cinnamon and caramel woven among the darker, smoky notes. Give it plenty of breathing time."

The wine itself is totally dry and silky and firm in acidity, yet soft in fine tannins. You might call it noble. It's eruptive in cherries, sweet smoky bacon, raspberry granola and oaky sandalwood. Gorgeous, seductive and brilliant, a truly great Pinot Noir that's impeccable now."
223001,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata 2005 Nicasia Vineyard Malbec (Mendoza),Argentina,123,96,2005,Mendoza Province,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bodega-catena-zapata-2005-nicasia-vineyard-malbec-mendoza/,"Features intoxicating pastry, blueberry, cola and coffee aromas in front of a minerally, terroir-packed palate of soft black fruit, chocolate, fine herbs and other character-aiding touches. The mouthfeel is fabulous and the finish of Swiss chocolate and integrated spice is as smooth as silk. Drink now through 2011."
222125,Montepulciano,Masciarelli 2004 Villa Gemma  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),Italy,100,95,2004,Central Italy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/masciarelli-2004-villa-gemma-italian-red-montepulciano-montepulciano-dabruzzo/,"The Abruzzo region of Central Italy boasts many unknown treasures; among the most beautiful of its riches is Villa Gemma. The late vintner Gianni Masciarelli has tamed the wild beast that is Montepulciano by creating a smooth, soft and extraordinarily rich wine that speaks volumes about the territory and the man who shaped it."
222128,Pinot Noir,Miner 2007 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),US,60,95,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/miner-2007-garys-vineyard-pinot-noir-central-coast-santa-lucia-highlands/,"An outstanding Pinot, absolutely, decadently good, that combines attributes of the fine vintage with some fine parcels from this celebrated vineyard. Softly lush, it shows fabulous flavors of cherries, red currants, licorice, cola, orange peel, sandalwood and Asian spices, but never loses structural balance and control."
222129,Red Blend,K Vintners 2006 En Chamberlin Roma Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),US,60,95,2006,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/k-vintners-2006-en-chamberlin-roma-red-columbia-valley-walla-walla-wa/,"The En Chamberlin vineyard, farmed biodynamically by Christophe Baron of Cayuse, is the source for this 62% Cabernet Sauvignon/38% Syrah blend. Concentrated and dense, beautifully structured with the herbal flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon set against tart wild berry and hints of citrusy acid."
222130,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sineann 2007 Block One Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),US,72,95,2007,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/sineann-2007-block-one-cabernet-sauvignon-columbia-valley-wa/,"The Block One Cab from the Champoux vineyard (in Washington's Horse Heaven Hills AVA) is one of Washington's gold-plated, old vine sites, and the wineries who get that fruit are equally special. Power, texture and pure pleasure combine here, a seductive mélange of black cherry, cassis, plum, coffee, chocolate and spice. Tannins are ripe, fine-grained, and have the weight to balance the fruit and oak. A triumph of vineyard and winemaker."
222131,Cabernet Sauvignon,Piña 2006 Buckeye Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),US,85,95,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/pina-2006-buckeye-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-howell-mountain/,"This outstanding wine shows the best features of Howell Mountain. It's gigantic in concentrated flavors of blackberries and black cherries, cocoa and cedar, with hints of wild herbs and even flowers. And although it's tannic, there's a mellow mouthfeel that permits drinking now. But it should age well through 2018."
222132,Red Blend,Côte Bonneville 2005 DuBrul Vineyard Red Red (Yakima Valley),US,120,95,2005,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/cote-bonneville-2005-dubrul-vineyard-red-columbia-valley-yakima/,"Graceful and aromatic, this 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Merlot is the top end wine from the estate-grown DuBrul vineyard. It has both elegance and intensity, and expresses power without falling prey to over-ripeness, excessive oak or other tricks of the trade. It captures the fruit and earth and herb of the Bordeaux grapes, tossing in hints of graphite and cedar and smoke. A wine that demands your attention, and warrants your applause."
223061,Cabernet Sauvignon,Betz Family 2006 Père de Famille Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),US,58,96,2006,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/betz-family-2006-pere-famille-cabernet-sauvignon-columbia-valley-wa/,"This is taut, muscular, toasty, young and tight; the fruit is concentrated, pure and evocative, with earthy flavors that add notes of soil, spice and mineral. The most complex of all the Betz blends, in this vintage it includes 84% Cabernet Sauvignon—far and away the dominant flavor. The fruits unfold in a rich panoply of reds and blues; the tannins are rich and chewy, polished and complex, showing exemplary back of the palate grip and concentration."
223062,Cabernet Sauvignon,Abeja 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),US,80,96,2005,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/abeja-2005-reserve-cabernet-sauvignon-columbia-valley-wa/,"Mostly old (1972) Bacchus vineyard fruit is 100% Cabernet, and only the second reserve Cabernet ever produced by Abeja. It's dark, juicy, dense, smoky, layered and tight. Pepper, bacon, coffee grounds, graphite and black cherry roll through the palate, buttressed with lots of firm, smooth, polished and delicious tannins. A truly glorious bottle."
223063,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt 2005 Single Vineyard Selection Game Ranch Plus Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),US,150,96,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/goldschmidt-2005-single-vineyard-selection-game-ranch-plus-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-oakville/,"With this bottling Goldschmidt runs with the big Oakville dogs. Classic, a dry, tremendously concentrated and oaky Cab with massive flavors of blackberry tart, cassis, anise, cocoa and cedar. So soft, you can drink it now, but the complex tannin structure and balance permit it to age for many years. The source is a tiny vineyard west of the Silverado Trail."
223064,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards 2006 Klopp Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),US,57,96,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/merry-edwards-2006-klopp-ranch-pinot-noir-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"Made in the Merry Edwards style, which is powerfully ripe and extracted, yet always balanced. Dazzles with enormous cherry pie filling, cola, sassafras, beef jerky, raspberry tart, anise, pepper and smoky cedar flavors that finish with amazing length. Yet the tannin-acid structure is superb, and the wine is totally dry. Beautiful now, and should age through 2012."
223065,Zinfandel,Hartford 2007 Highwire Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),US,55,96,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/hartford-2007-highwire-vineyard-zinfandel-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"The vineyard is in Fulton, a cool part of the southeastern valley heavily influenced by fog, and the vines are about 100 years old. This is great, classic Zinfandel. It should be in a museum. Despite high alcohol, it has a silky, Pinot-esque suppleness, balanced with crisp acids, and is profoundly rich in Zinny flavor. Currants, mushu plum sauce, anise, crushed black pepper, dark chocolate and rich Asian spices last forever on the finish."
223066,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata 2005 Argentino Malbec (Mendoza),Argentina,123,96,2005,Mendoza Province,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bodega-catena-zapata-2005-argentino-malbec-mendoza/,"This blend from the Nicasia and Adrianna vineyards is the best Malbec on the market today. There's raisin, mineral, licorice, blackberry and more. The mouth is like a Mack truck on ice skates, meaning it's both huge and elegant. And the mile-long finish of coffee, mocha and molten black fruit is awesome. Drink now through 2013."
223054,Tinta de Toro,Numanthia 2006 Termanthia  (Toro),Spain,200,95,2006,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/numanthia-termes-sl-2006-termanthia-tempranillo-tinta-de-toro-toro/,"Termanthia is the pinnacle of Tinta de Toro. Aromas of wild blackberry, crude oil, forest floor and truffles are just now showing themselves, while the tight, tannic palate is full of black plum, blackberry and bitter chocolate flavors. Espresso and roast meat notes grace the dark, jam-packed finish, and as a whole this is one bold, boisterous wine. Best in 2011 thru 2013. Only 531 cases."
223055,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court 2007 Arrendell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),US,85,95,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/hartford-court-2007-arrendell-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"The winery's most expensive wine comes from very low-yielding Martini selection grapes planted in 1975. The '07, tasted at a bit more than one year of age, was pronounced in smoky oak and robust tannins, showing jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, blueberries, anise, cloves and cedar. Hold this powerful wine until 2011."
223056,Pinot Noir,Merry Edwards 2006 Flax Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),US,54,95,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/merry-edwards-2006-flax-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"The vineyard was made famous by Williams Selyem for fantastically rich, ageable Pinot Noirs. Now Merry Edwards has her own bottling, and it's right up there. Tastes young and grape-sappy, with jammy black cherry, cola, licorice and dusty Asian spice flavors, perfectly accented with smoky new oak. Needs time, and will develop complexities through 2012, at least."
223058,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Andrew Will 2006 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),US,55,95,2006,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/andrew-will-2006-ciel-cheval-vineyard-red-wine-columbia-valley-red-mountain/,"This is darn near perfect, a matchless expression of berries, dotted with chocolate, vanilla and butterscotch. The berry flavors, highlighted with crisp acids, strike a pure note and ring true over a long, long finish. The blend is 40% Merlot, 37% Cab Franc, 19% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Petit Verdot. Great concentration, finesse and length."
224162,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court 2007 Hailey's Block Pinot Noir (Green Valley),US,60,95,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/hartford-court-2007-haileys-block-pinot-noir-sonoma-green-valley/,"This is from a block of younger vines made from Dijon clones within the larger Arrendell Vineyard. The wine is quite full-bodied and robust, almost rustic, which is mainly due to the powerful, young tannins. With explosive berry, currant and mocha flavors, this powerful wine should hit its stride in mid-2010."
224163,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Kendall-Jackson 2006 Highland Estates Trace Ridge Red (Knights Valley),US,125,97,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/kendall-jackson-2006-highland-estates-trace-ridge-red-sonoma-knights-valley/,"Dark, viscous and monumental, this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend detonates on the palate with black currants, chocolate and cedar concentration, wrapped into the most perfect tannins. Outstanding, and should age for many years. Only 277 cases of this wine, which was grown on steep hillsides, were produced."
225321,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hall 2006 Kathryn Hall Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,75,95,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/hall-2006-kathryn-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"Outstanding for its purity, and the incredibly fine tannins, not to mention the compelling flavors. Black and red cherries, currants, cola, mushrooms, cedar, anise, and spice flavors mingle into a long, rich finish. So balanced and elegant. Made from 95% Sacrashe Vineyard fruit, in the Rutherford AVA."
225131,Cabernet Sauvignon,David Arthur 2006 Elevation 1147 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,135,95,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/david-arthur-2006-elevation-1147-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is a best barrels selection. It's the densest, most tannic of David Arthur's current releases, a massive wine stuffed with black currants, blackberries, anise, tobacco and smoky new oak. Best of all, it's dry, dry, dry. Fine now, if you're into young wines, but should age well in a good cellar for many years."
225322,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Alpha Omega 2006 Proprietary Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),US,82,95,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/alpha-omega-2006-proprietary-red-wine-napa-valley/,"This is a big, powerful Bordeaux blend that clearly needs time. Tasted in early 2009, it's very tannic and dry, although you can detect the massive cassis and plum flavors. It would be a pity to open before 2012, if you can keep your hands off it. Could eventually stun. Alpha Omega is a winery to watch."
225319,Cabernet Sauvignon,Barnett 2006 Rattlesnake Hill Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),US,125,95,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/barnett-2006-rattlesnake-hill-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-spring-mountain/,"This is a tremendous Cabernet Sauvignon, but be warned, it's so tannic, it makes your tongue curl. That's what mountain grapes, grown at 2,000 feet with low yields and small berries, do. Such is the core of black currants, however, that aging is not a problem. With its dryness, intensity and overall balance, it should easily negotiate the next decade. Really displays Napa mountain Cab at its best."
225320,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kendall-Jackson 2006 Highland Estates Napa Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),US,70,95,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/kendall-jackson-2006-highland-estates-napa-mountain-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-mount-veeder/,"The huge, thick tannins are all from the wine's 1,500-foot mountain vineyard, but they're so soft and refined, the wine is instantly drinkable, although it will age for many years. Tastes dramatically luscious for the depth and length of black currant, olive, chocolate and cedar flavors."
225323,Cabernet Sauvignon,Meander 2005 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),US,100,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/meander-2005-morisoli-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-rutherford/,"Outstanding. Ultra-ripe and lush, but very dry, showing powerful, long hangtime flavors of black and red sour cherries, currants, violets and cedar, wrapped into dense, melted tannins. Almost Porty, but stops short of overripeness to finish with dramatic richness. The vineyard is adjacent to Rubicon's, in the heart of the Rutherford bench."
225325,Cabernet Sauvignon,David Arthur 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,95,96,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/david-arthur-2006-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"Here's an important new Cabernet that instantly takes its place in the increasingly crowded Napa pantheon. It's extraordinarily rich in black currants, chocolate, anise, pepper and cedar flavors that are wrapped into perfectly ripened tannins. Feels lush, plush and smooth in the mouth, and should age effortlessly for a decade or more."
225327,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Rubicon Estate 2005 Rubicon Red (Rutherford),US,145,96,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/rubicon-estate-2005-rubicon-red-napa-rutherford/,"Made from 98% Cabernet Sauvignon, with no Merlot or Cabernet Franc for the first time, the '05 Rubicon tastes bigger and more impenetrable than any previous vintage. It's thick and heavy at this time, with furry tannins and undeniably ripe flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherries, violets, chocolate and cedar, and a tang of melted minerals. Desperately needs time in the cellar. Nowhere near ready for at least four years, and that may be conservative. Tasted three times, and better each time, a seriously good sign, and potentially a perfect wine."
225328,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Kendall-Jackson 2004 Stature Red (Napa Valley),US,110,96,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/kendall-jackson-2004-stature-red-napa-valley/,"Stature is always a Bordeaux blend, but varies in vineyard source each year. This '04 is soft, utterly delicious and fully drinkable now. It's rich in black currant, cherry pie filling, plum, anise and spice flavors, generously aged in smoky new oak. Made in the modern style, it will hold effortlessly through 2012, at least."
225329,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pride Mountain 2006 Vintner Select Cuvée Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,85,96,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/pride-mountain-2006-vintner-select-cuvee-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"What a fine, beautiful wine this is. Shows every graceful aspect of a modern Napa Cab, from the perfectly ripened fruit to the unbelievably fine tannins and application of oak. Thrills the mouth with decadently rich black currants, crême de cassis, milk chocolate, anise and cedar flavors, but never loses an impeccable sense of balance and control. Best now, even without decanting, and through 2014."
225331,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Hall 2006 Exzellenz Red Wine Sacrashe Vineyard Red (Rutherford),US,150,97,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/hall-2006-exzellenz-red-wine-sacrashe-vineyard-napa-rutherford/,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is like a neutron star, with massive power packed into a concentrated mass. Just huge in black currants, black cherries and chocolate, almost as thick as molasses, yet dry and firm and minerally. Vast weight and authority. Needs time. Will last 15–20 years."
226153,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate 2005 Cristina Don Miguel Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),US,52,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/marimar-estate-2005-cristina-don-miguel-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"Gorgeous and delicious, this low-production bottling is a best-of-barrels selection named for Marimar Torres's daughter. It's an exceptional wine that's compelling not only for its vivacity but also its complexity. Offers wave after wave of cherries, pomegranates, rhubarb pie, roasted coconut, red licorice, tangerine zest, sweet vanilla oak and Asian spices through a long finish."
226154,Cabernet Sauvignon,Oakville East 2005 Exposure Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),US,125,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/oakville-east-2005-exposure-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-oakville/,"They call it east, because the grapes are from the Vaca Mountains, and the vineyard faces west. It's a splendid wine, classically proportioned, with rich, thick tannins that have true Napa refinement. The flavors are also classic, suggesting cassis and cedar, with a distinct smack of indescribable minerals. There's a lot of smoky new oak, but it's proportionate to the wine's power. This serious new Napa Cab is great now, and should develop for many years."
226171,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,BOND 2005 The Matriarch Red (Napa Valley),US,90,98,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bond-2005-matriarch-red-napa-valley/,"This year's Matriarch is very similar to Harlan Estate in structure, and in some ways, a superior wine, or at least more delicious now. Shows the most beautiful black currant, cedar, blueberry pie and Asian spice flavors. What makes the structure so gorgeous are the firm tannins. Ultimately, it's a refined, exquisite red wine. Hard to imagine a better one for drinking over the next decade, and just shows that price sometimes has no relationship to quality."
226158,Red Blend,Joseph Phelps 2005 Insignia Red (Napa Valley),US,200,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/joseph-phelps-2005-insignia-red-napa-valley/,"This is not a wine for tonight, or next year, or for at least the next six years. It's shut down in tannins, with an astringency that can't be overcome even with decanting, although that won't stop people from opening it before its time. Buried beneath the tannins are well-developed black currant, roasted meat and cedar flavors that define upscale Napa Cab. Really fine and distinguished, a wine to cellar and enjoy for many years."
226159,Pinot Noir,Lost Canyon 2007 Widdoes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),US,42,95,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/lost-canyon-2007-widdoes-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"Voluptuous, lush, a wine of great power. Packed with cedar-inspired flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, currants, cassis, cola, licorice and spice, wrapped into a texture of velvet and silk. Delicious and compelling. Only 126 cases produced."
226160,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Woodward Canyon 2006 Estate Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),US,59,95,2006,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/woodward-canyon-2006-estate-red-wine-columbia-valley-walla-walla-wa/,"This is Woodward Canyon's reserve—the best lots of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot create this very limited wine. It is built to age, and reflects the tight and muscular style that Rick Small has developed over the years. There is a strong mineral-metal vein running through the black and blue fruits, and some very lively spicy highlights. Tannins are ripe but firm, and this is a wine that will benefit from further cellaring."
226161,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Harlan Estate 2005 Red (Napa Valley),US,450,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/harlan-estate-2005-red-napa-valley/,"Smells a bit minty and peppery, but once in the mouth, turns ultra-generous in black currant, chocolate-covered mint and spicy cedar flavors. Massive, yet refined and elegant, and even with the firm tannins, grows more charming as it warms in the glass. Very fine quality, and likely to hold for many years."
226162,Cabernet Sauvignon,Staglin 2005 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),US,175,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/staglin-2005-estate-cabernet-sauvignon-rutherford-94731/,"Black in color, glyceriney. Massive, deep, tremendous. Some will find it overpowering in New World extraction, but it's a real beauty in that style. Explodes in black currants, chocolate and new oak, almost overripe, with suggestions of raisins. Almost dessert-like, but stays dry and elegant. Defines modern Napa Valley cult Cabernet Sauvignon."
226165,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,BOND 2005 Melbury Red (Napa Valley),US,275,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bond-2005-melbury-red-napa-valley/,"Lots of fresh herbs and spices in this beautiful red wine. Offers loads of red and black currants and chocolate, with a fine application of cedar and cigar box from oak. Very fine, enormously likeable. Drink now through 2015."
226167,Cabernet Sauvignon,Joseph Phelps 2005 Backus Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),US,225,97,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/joseph-phelps-2005-backus-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-oakville/,"Price be damned, this is an authentically gorgeous, important Cabernet Sauvignon. It calls to mind the amazing 2001, with its huge, perfect tannins and acids and artistic appliqué of new oak. But the star of the show surely is the fruit. Mounds of ripe blackberries and cherries pile up, veering into currants and cassis and something wild and decadently animal, like charred meat. Fabulous now despite the firm tannins, and should evolve for many years."
226169,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,BOND 2005 Vecina Red (Napa Valley),US,275,97,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bond-2005-vecina-red-napa-valley/,"Very refined, with lovely perfume. Heady, showing currants, cassis, cedar, chocolate-covered cherries and sweet herbs. Decadent, classy, elegant, with a great tannin structure. Just oozes class."
226170,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Harlan Estate 2005 The Maiden Red (Napa Valley),US,150,97,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/harlan-estate-2005-maiden-red-napa-valley/,"Massive, decadent. Opens with extraordinary aromas of cedar, black currants, cherries, chocolate, sage, pepper and anise, with hints of roasted game. Feels very round, smooth but powerful. Almost sweet in red and black currants and chocolate. So refined, absolutely delicious. Beautiful, lush, complex, soft. Should age."
226155,Cabernet,Justin 2006 Reserve Cabernet (Paso Robles),US,45,95,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/justin-2006-reserve-bordeaux-style-red-blend-cabernet-central-coast-paso-robles/,"Although this Cab is quite tannic, it's really good now. Shows impeccable balance in a New World style that oozes black and red currants, dark chocolate, licorice, cedar and plums, with a note of raw, bloody meat. Very high quality, an excellent rendition of western Paso Robles hillside Cabernet. Good through 2015, with proper cellaring."
226157,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Flora Springs 2005 Trilogy Red (Napa Valley),US,65,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/flora-springs-2005-trilogy-red-napa-valley/,"A drop-dead gorgeous red blend that continues Flora Springs' fine streak of Bordeaux-style wines. Full-bodied and dry, it's balanced and rich, with complex flavors of currants, minerals, cedar and spice. The tannins are strong, but ultra-refined. Drink this high-quality wine now and through 2015."
227230,Cabernet Sauvignon,Flora Springs 2005 Rennie Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),US,100,96,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/flora-springs-2005-rennie-reserve-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-st-helena/,"An extraordinary wine, among the greatest Cabs in Flora Springs' long history. One hundred percent varietal, and made from a single clone, it shows fabulous density and serious weight, with dramatically rich blackberry, currant and cedar flavors anchored by a firm minerality. For all its power, the wine is balanced and elegant. An ager, it will drink well for at least a decade."
227105,Nebbiolo,Ceretto 2004 Bricco Rocche Bricco Rocche  (Barolo),Italy,230,95,2004,Piedmont,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/ceretto-2004-bricco-rocche-bricco-rocche-nebbiolo-barolo/,"This excellent Barolo from Ceretto's Bricco Rocche estate represents a perfect marriage between grape and winemaking. The integrity of the fruit is there—plush, round, intense—and is supported by oak-driven notes of vanilla, cinnamon, cigar box and ground ginger. In the mouth, it tastes smooth and supple and offers long-lasting intensity. Drink after 2020."
227216,Cabernet Sauvignon,Selene 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,70,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/selene-2005-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"From Mia Klein, this is a seriously good Cabernet Sauvignon, even better than the winery's fine 2004. It shows a great balance of ripe tannins and fine acidity, with a judicious application of smoky oak. The flavors, of black currants and ripe mashed black cherries, have complex overtones of dark chocolate, olive tapenade and mushu plum sauce. Gorgeous now, and should age effortlessly for a decade."
227217,Nebbiolo,Gaja 2004 Conteisa Nebbiolo (Langhe),Italy,255,95,2004,Piedmont,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/gaja-2004-conteisa-nebbiolo-langhe/,"Gaja's answer to Barolo, Conteisa means “contested” in Piedmontese and refers to the historic feud between the towns of Barolo and La Morra for the shared Cerequio cru. This gorgeous wine is thick and dark with beautiful concentration and sophisticated notes of dark fruit, mineral and exotic spice. The wine is smooth and solid with firm tannins and structure. It will age for 20-plus years."
227218,Syrah,Abacela 2005 South Face Block Reserve Syrah (Southern Oregon),US,45,95,2005,Oregon,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/abacela-2005-south-face-block-reserve-shiraz-syrah-syrah-southern/,"Look out, Hermitage, this has the grip, the earthiness, the herbs and spice, and above all the massive, ripe, complex fruit to compete. The layers of this wine just keep unfolding; the longer it breathes, the more it gives you. Crushed rock, lead pencil, Asian spice, blackberry, coffee and caramel…it never stops. What a superb achievement."
227219,Red Blend,Joan Simó 2005 Les Eres Vinyes Velles Red (Priorat),Spain,84,95,2005,Catalonia,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/joan-simo-2005-eres-vinyes-velles-red-priorat/,"A great Priorat, plain and simple. And while we have always liked Les Eres from Joan Simó, this vintage is the best we've tried. The nose is beautiful: coffee, cola, schist, black fruit and herbs rise up. In the mouth, there's strength but restraint; huge black fruit, pulsing tannins and subtleties. Power and precision as well. A brilliant wine that can be drunk now with decanting, or better: hold for another 4–12 years."
227221,Nebbiolo,Vietti 2005 Rocche  (Barolo),Italy,125,95,2005,Piedmont,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/vietti-2005-rocche-nebbiolo-barolo/,"Rocche is a standout wine that offers just about everything you look for in an excellent Barolo. There's power, complexity and personality here that is enhanced by lusciously intense aromas of chocolate, allspice, blackberry, licorice and cola. It's a beautifully healthy wine with a bright color, bold extraction, a soft finish and direct delivery. Drink in 5–10 years."
227222,Zinfandel,Gary Farrell 2006 Bradford Mountain Vineyards Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),US,40,95,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/gary-farrell-2006-bradford-mountain-vineyards-zinfandel-sonoma-dry-creek-valley/,"Shows a dramatic interpretation of Dry Creek terroir, with intense wild berry, mocha and spice flavors that are so ripe, they veer into currants and grilled blackberries. Entirely dry, the wine is marked by rich, complex tannins. Superb, a great wine, as good as Zinfandel gets. Drink now through 2012."
227223,Nebbiolo,Gaja 2005 Sorì Tildìn Nebbiolo (Langhe),Italy,445,95,2005,Piedmont,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/gaja-2005-sori-tildin-nebbiolo-langhe/,"Dense and concentrated in appearance, Sorì Tildìn (with 5% Barbera) is the plushest and roundest of Gaja's single-vineyard wines. Thanks to the quality of the fruit, the excellent vintage and 12 months of barrique, the final result is an austere and important wine with deep tones of black cherry, licorice, anise, tobacco and cedar. It closes after many long minutes with decisive tannins and cooling freshness. Drink after 2020."
227225,Tinta de Toro,Maurodos 2005 San Román  (Toro),Spain,67,95,2005,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/maurodos-2005-san-roman-tempranillo-tinta-de-toro-toro/,"We would not have expected anything to match the stellar 2004 San Román, but this newest vintage is up to the task. It's opaque as midnight without a moon, and the nose is a delectable blend of vanilla, spice, hickory, mocha and meaty blackberry. The palate is both magnetic and sly; it pumps black fruit galore, but augments things with controlled chocolate and spice. Finishes a mile long, with cream, intensity and guile. This wine does not mess around. Best from 2010–2016."
227231,Nebbiolo,Gaja 2005 Sorì San Lorenzo Nebbiolo (Langhe),Italy,445,96,2005,Piedmont,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/gaja-2005-sori-san-lorenzo-nebbiolo-langhe/,"You cannot not love this wine: layered and intense with extraordinary integrity of fruit, it offers supple flavors of dark fruit, spice, tobacco and chocolate. It's dense, succulent and penetrating with polished tannins and long persistency. The palate becomes coated with opulence and richness: 5% Barbera is added. Drink 2015–2030."
227232,Cabernet Sauvignon,Spottswoode 2005 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),US,130,97,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/spottswoode-2005-estate-grown-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-st-helena/,"Tasted in a big lineup of St. Helena Cabernets, Spottswoode's magnificent '05 stood out. It's a massive powerhouse, explosive in black currant, cherry pie, plum, chocolate, anise and cedar flavors that are detailed and precise. However, the wine, which was blended with a little Cabernet Franc, is graceful and balanced. Drinkable now due to its softly refined tannins, but has the integrity to ride out the years. Easy to find, with 3,896 cases produced."
228307,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Margaux 2006  Margaux,France,NULL,95,2006,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-margaux-2006-red-margaux/,"This is not a big Château Margaux, its style showing more elegance and discretion. The tannins are soft, although producing a dense web that lies underneath the black currant and plum fruit flavors. It is a wine that envelops the mouth, an edge of firmness over velvet fruit textures. The wine floats away slowly on the close."
228308,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Léoville Las Cases 2006  Saint-Julien,France,NULL,95,2006,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-leoville-las-cases-2006-red-saint-julien/,"While the aromas are tight and firm, once it is in the mouth, this wine just explodes. The tannins are dark, almost impenetrable, dry and dense. These tannins are a layer over the fruit that just piles up with ripe blackberry juice, an edge of blueberry. The soft sweetness of this range of flavors continues on the finish, pitted against the tannins."
228310,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hall 2005 Bergfeld Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),US,100,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/hall-2005-bergfeld-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-st-helena/,"This is one of those Napa Cabs that tastes glamorous. Even people who know little about wine will taste it and go, Wow. And the longer it sits in the glass and airs, the better it gets. Bone dry, soft and smooth, it shows luscious black currant, plum, sage, spice and cedar flavors, wrapped into finely ground tannins that will enable it to age for a decade."
228320,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau Rollat 2005 Edouard de Rollat Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),US,62,95,2005,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-rollat-2005-edouard-cabernet-sauvignon-columbia-valley-walla-walla-wa/,"This is a showstopper, the top of the line at Chateau Rollat, certainly one of the most exciting new ventures to open in Walla Walla in the past decade. Deep and compact, it's a classic wine to cellar, holding its dark and smoky secrets tightly wound around a core of dense black fruits nuanced with streaks of bark, soil, earth and barrel. A subtle, moody and yet quite expressive wine, it engages the intellect as well as the palate—a rare treat indeed."
228321,Merlot,Shafer 2006 Merlot (Napa Valley),US,48,95,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/shafer-2006-merlot-napa-valley/,"Easily Shafer's greatest Merlot ever. Certainly its richest, with fabulously concentrated blackberry, cherry, licorice, chocolate and cinnamon spice flavors. All this is wrapped into extraordinarily sweet, refined tannins. Addictively drinkable, but not a long ager. Best now and through 2012."
228322,Pinot Noir,Siduri 2007 Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),US,50,96,2007,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/siduri-2007-hirsch-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-coast/,"This is the tightest, most tannic and ageworthy of Siduri's 2007 Pinot Noirs. It's a huge wine, with a wealth of exotic berry, leather, teriyaki beef, Dr. Pepper, mocha and Asian spice flavors that finish entirely dry. Gorgeous now, and should slowly develop over the next eight years, if not longer."
228323,Pinot Noir,Pessagno 2006 Four Boys Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),US,55,96,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/pessagno-2006-four-boys-vineyard-pinot-noir-central-coast-santa-lucia-highlands/,"Just gorgeous, an absolutely wonderful Pinot Noir to drink. Fully dry and crisp in coastal acidity, it shows rich, complex flavors of cherries, red currants and mocha, with a grounding, earthy animality suggesting grilled mushrooms and beef jerky. Beautiful now, and should gradually improve for a decade."
228324,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Latour 2006  Pauillac,France,NULL,96,2006,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-latour-2006-red-pauillac/,"Latour has always had the reputation of producing great wines in the less great vintages. The 2006 is a case in point. It brings structure and ripeness into a form that is almost ethereal. That elegance doesn't take away from the powerful fruit. The fruit in fact melds into the structure with ease. And, as a reminder this is a 2006, the density gives way to freshness on the finish."
228326,Cabernet Sauvignon,Etude 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,85,96,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/etude-2005-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"Etude's 2005 defines power and authority, Napa style. It's hard to imagine a Cabernet Sauvignon more explosive in blackberry, cherry and chocolate fruit flavor. Yet the structure is superb, with firm but ultrarefined tannins providing an architecture to house all that richness. Beautiful now, and should age gracefully for a decade. Relatively easy to find, with 4,600 cases produced."
228327,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem 2006 Precious Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),US,90,96,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/williams-selyem-2006-precious-mountain-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-coast/,"This wine is light on the palate, almost airy. The official alcohol reading is under 14%. Yet it packs the power of the world's greatest reds. Wild cherries and raspberries, with impossibly complex mocha, cola, anise, cinnamon and other flavors impossible to describe but endlessly fascinating. Gorgeous now, and should evolve for at least six years."
228328,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château La Mission Haut-Brion 2006  Pessac-Léognan,France,NULL,96,2006,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-mission-haut-brion-2006-red-pessac-leognan/,"Wonderful sweet fruit, velvet in texture, with concentrated ripe fruits and red berries. This is a wine that rolls sumptuously around the mouth, the tannins certainly dense but full of the same sweetness as the fruit. The final flavor is perfumed and fresh. Deceptively attractive, it will profit from many years' aging."
228329,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem 2006 Weir Vineyard Pinot Noir (Yorkville Highlands),US,56,96,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/williams-selyem-2006-weir-vineyard-pinot-noir-north-coast-yorkville-highlands/,"Williams Selyem's best Weir ever. Shows vast richness of flavor, with a flood of wild red berry currant, cherry pie, Dr. Pepper, Asian spice and smoky oak flavors, with hints of roasted meat and mocha. Yet it displays gorgeous structure. The tannins are as refined as anything in California. Great now, and should evolve for a decade in a cool cellar."
228330,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Lafite Rothschild 2006  Pauillac,France,NULL,96,2006,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-lafite-rothschild-2006-red-pauillac/,"As so often with Lafite, it is power that marks this wine. That, and density of texture. The additional element in this vintage, and at this stage of the wine's development, is a dominant wood element. The vanilla and tannins from the wood match well with the concentrated tannins of the fruit, which is dark, dense and tight. This is a wine for long-term aging: in 15 years this will have superb richness."
228331,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Haut-Brion 2006  Pessac-Léognan,France,NULL,96,2006,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-haut-brion-2006-red-pessac-leognan/,"A severe, austere wine that doesn't show its richness easily. The tannins are tight and firm and they dominate. Underneath is ripe fruit, the balance with tannins giving a foursquare, solid character. The wine is complex, spice playing with the fruit, some medicinal flavors and a definite stalky, tight structure. It obviously needs long-term aging."
228332,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem 2006 Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),US,75,97,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/williams-selyem-2006-rochioli-riverblock-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"Accomplishes the impossible, stunning the palate with the most delicious flavors imaginable, yet with the structural integrity to age. Those flavors intoxicate with cherry pie, black raspberry tart, tangerine zest and mocha, finished with exotic spicebox and sweet, charred new oak smokiness, all enveloped in sheer silkiness and ultrarefined tannins. Drink now–2018."
228334,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Ausone 2006  Saint-Émilion,France,NULL,97,2006,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-ausone-2006-red-saint-emilion/,"Strength and elegance go together in this wine. It has a pure line of clear berry fruits that float above the tannic core. It is not so much rich as dense, the tannins a vivid counterpoint to the fruit. The wine finishes with fine, elegant sweetness, but it is the purity of line that stays in the memory. Age for 10 years at least."
228335,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Mouton Rothschild 2006  Pauillac,France,NULL,97,2006,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-mouton-rothschild-2006-red-pauillac/,"At the time it was shown as a barrel sample in early 2007, this was the best wine of 2006. That accolade remains. It has all the power of the Cabernet Sauvignon in Pauillac, which was the greatest success of the vintage. That power comes from the dense tannins as well as the black plum and spice flavors and minerality. The texture becomes velvet, giving a final richness, but never losing its long aging potential. In a year that is good, but not at the top, Mouton has made a great wine."
228336,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Pétrus 2006  Pomerol,France,NULL,97,2006,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-petrus-2006-red-pomerol/,"After the fabulous 2005, Pétrus again has produced a magnificent wine in 2006, even if it doesn't hit quite the same heights. It has an immensely powerful structure and concentration, always the hallmark of this wine. But this structure is almost masked by the superbly ripe and fresh fruit. And with all this weight, there is still a sense of proportion, the rich berry fruits, smokiness and light spice beautifully integrated."
228338,Cabernet Sauvignon,Shafer 2004 Hillside Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),US,215,100,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/shafer-2004-hillside-select-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-stags-leap-district/,"A perfect score has to be considered in the context of its region. Shafer's 2004 Hillside Select is tremendous as a Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon that competes with its peers at the highest levels. It's always a fabulous wine, but in warm 2004, Shafer's amphitheater vineyard sheltered the grapes, ripening them to perfection yet protecting the “iron fist in a velvet glove” structure that André Tchelistcheff defined as Stags Leap. This 100% Cabernet is tremendous in cassis, black currant and mocha flavors, and the 100% new French oak provides perfect additions of smoke and caramel. It's soft and gorgeous enough to drink now, and should age well in a cool cellar for the next 20 years."
228312,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Pavie 2006  Saint-Émilion,France,NULL,95,2006,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-pavie-2006-red-saint-emilion/,"Always ripe, always velvety and dense in texture, Pavie's 2006 nevertheless also shows more structure and elegance than in the past few vintages. The result is a great wine, with smoky, rich fruit and a dense, concentrated core of sweet tannins, chocolate and fresh raspberry flavors. While it is seductive now, it really needs many years of aging."
228313,Syrah,Betz Family 2006 La Serenne Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),US,55,95,2006,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/betz-family-2006-serenne-shiraz-syrah-syrah-columbia-valley-wa/,"Toasty, dense, dark and complex, this is suffused with a complex mix of coffee, earth, butterscotch, cherry and mineral, with an underlayer of game, roasted almond, herb and earth. Still a baby, young and tight, it opens out with decanting, turning silky and supple. The balance is impeccable, and herbal nuances are preserved, despite the 14.7% alcohol."
228316,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Angélus 2006  Saint-Émilion,France,NULL,95,2006,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-angelus-2006-red-saint-emilion/,"Initially the wine is all firm tannins, but then there is a pure line of fresh black fruits that comes through, with cranberry tannins and blackberry jamminess. Above it all, is succulent richness and clear acidity. A beautifully shaped wine."
228317,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Trotanoy 2006  Pomerol,France,NULL,95,2006,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-trotanoy-2006-red-pomerol/,"This is a strongly structured and impressively textured wine. The tannins shoot through, giving a sense of dryness. But in the center, the wine shows power through both tannins and fruit, with blackberries and red plums. It has a precision and shape that promises long aging."
228319,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Cos d'Estournel 2006  Saint-Estèphe,France,200,95,2006,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-cos-destournel-2006-red-saint-estephe/,"Cos d'Estournel has softened those austere Saint-Estèphe tannins and produced a wine that is all opulence and roundness. The tannins are certainly there, but they come through as big, bold richness. The power suggests it will age well, but for drinking earlier, the freshness of the sweet homemade plum jam promises well."
230013,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père &amp; Fils 2006  Clos de Vougeot,France,200,95,2006,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bouchard-pere-fils-2006-pinot-noir-clos-vougeot/,"Not all Clos Vougeot lives up to its billing, but this wine certainly does. With its superbly ripe fruit, a harmonious balance between fruit, tannins and acidity, and a full, generous texture, this is a wine to savor. It is a big wine in all senses, except that it has a great sense of proportion. Enjoy this wine in 2–3 years, or age for 10."
229210,Cabernet Sauvignon,Corison 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,75,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/corison-2005-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"This wine is so balanced it hits the palate as impeccable and gorgeous. The flavors, of currants, cherries, vanilla and sweet oak, are only part of it. It is so dry, so richly structured in tannins and acids, so pure through the long, spicy finish, that it easily deserves its high score. Will age well for up to a decade."
229211,Red Blend,Buoncristiani 2005 O.P.C. Proprietary Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),US,40,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/buoncristiani-2005-opc-proprietary-red-wine-napa-valley/,"Just gorgeous. Floods the mouth with decadent black currant, cherry, chocolate, anise, beef jerky and smoky oak flavors that stun for their addictive deliciousness. Yet it's perfectly dry, and the balance of rich, ripe tannins, acidity and smoky oak is near perfect. The wine is a blend of Bordeaux varieties and Syrah, from esteemed vineyards including Hyde, Stagecoach and Caldwell."
230016,Tempranillo Blend,Viñedos de Paganos 2005 El Puntido  (Rioja),Spain,65,95,2005,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/vinedos-paganos-2005-el-puntido-tempranillo-blend-rioja/,"Our wine of the year in 2007 (the '04 El Puntido) is back with a vengeance in the 2005 vintage. This is a deep-fruited modern specimen with that elusive mix of floral, fruit and meaty characteristics. The palate is ripe and everlasting, with berry, coffee and hickory flavors. Long and calm on the finish, with amazing texture. An excellent encore to the prior year's achievement."
230024,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père &amp; Fils 2006  Chambertin Clos de Bèze,France,575,96,2006,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bouchard-pere-fils-2006-pinot-noir-chambertin-clos-beze/,"Big and bold, this is real Chambertin, a dense mouthful of plum fruit and tannin. It is foursquare, solid but not overbearing, leaving room for a delicious mix of black fruits and power leavened with some acidity. Age this wine for 10 years."
230025,Pinot Noir,Bouchard Père &amp; Fils 2006  Bonnes-Mares,France,325,96,2006,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bouchard-pere-fils-2006-pinot-noir-bonnes-mares/,"A proper Bonnes-Mares, solidly rooted in its great terroir, very ripe but also densely structured. The wine builds up in layers, the flavors of chocolate, licorice and dark plum skins piling on top of each other. The acidity is there, but almost submerged in the richness and the ripe raspberry jam aftertaste."
230027,Pinot Noir,Domaine Anne Gros 2006 Le Grand Maupertui  (Clos de Vougeot),France,NULL,96,2006,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-anne-gros-2006-le-grand-maupertui-pinot-noir-clos-vougeot/,"A big, structured wine, still young, with a dense, firm character. The wine is solid, with concentrated black fruits that power deep down into the texture, adding their richness to licorice, bitter chocolate and inspired acidity. Age for at least five years."
230028,Pinot Noir,Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair 2005  La Romanée,France,2000,96,2005,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-comte-liger-belair-2005-pinot-noir-romanee/,"A wonderfully complete wine, with all the elements in place. It is ripe and powerful, the black fruits jammy and rich. But at the same time, the layer of acidity, the dark tannins and the succulent texture all come together in a finely balanced way. It is almost exotic, but the tannins promise good potential for aging."
230030,Pinot Noir,Chanson Père et Fils 2005  Charmes-Chambertin,France,225,96,2005,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chanson-pere-fils-2005-pinot-noir-charmes-chambertin/,"Dark in color, this is a rich, opulent, almost showy wine. The fruit is ripe, a combination of the sweetest strawberries with black cherries, laced with rich acidity. Then the tannins power in, a dry core of structure and density. Impressive and long-lasting, don't touch this wine for another six years at least."
230031,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Signorello 2005 Padrone Proprietary Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),US,110,97,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/signorello-2005-padrone-proprietary-red-wine-napa-valley/,"Marks a welcome return to the magnificence of the 2002, although more recent vintages haven't exactly been slouches. The '05 is amazing, a densely structured, deeply flavored Bordeaux blend that's mainly Cabernet Sauvignon. Shows classic notes of cassis, currants and black cherry liqueur, while 70% new oak adds enticingly rich layers of sweet toast and smoky vanilla. The tannins are pure, classic Napa, very refined and ripe, offering solid structural support with no trace of astringency. Beautiful now, and should slowly develop for many years."
230032,Tempranillo Blend,San Vicente 2005  Rioja,Spain,65,97,2005,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/san-vicente-2005-tempranillo-blend-rioja/,"Talk about a wine that makes you take notice. This is simply great modern Rioja. The nose is creamy but honest, with black fruit, mocha and finely tanned leather. The palate gives the whole range of berry and tree fruits, with expansive tannins and just enough core acidity to make it stunning. Ultra stylish and delicious; another huge success for the Eguren family that owns San Vicente and other Rioja properties."
230018,Cabernet Sauvignon,Girard 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),US,75,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/girard-2005-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-diamond-mountain-district/,"Where Girard's estate Cab is beautiful now, their Diamond Mountain bottling is one for the cellar. Veteran winemaker Marco DiGiulio has applied his considerable experience, with classic results. The wine is marked by firm tannins that make it astringent and sticky. But underneath all that is an explosion of currant, plum, licorice, chocolate and spicy curry flavor that dazzles. Should easily age for a long time in a proper cellar. Production was a paltry 325 cases, and worth the search."
230019,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beaulieu Vineyard 2005 Georges de Latour Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,105,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/beaulieu-vineyard-2005-georges-latour-private-reserve-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"Classic structured, firm and soft at the same time, with a lyrical, creamy mouthfeel. The tannins are evident now, but that is characteristic of a young Georges, and the reason it ages so well. The depth of blackberries, cherries and currants is unreal and persistent. This is one for the cellar and will age for at least a decade and probably far longer. Try to keep your hands off it until after 2011."
230020,Pinot Noir,Laetitia 2006 Reserve Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),US,40,95,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/laetitia-2006-reserve-pinot-noir-central-coast-arroyo-grande-valley/,"Laetitia's best reserve ever. In a word, gorgeous. There's a soft silkiness, a caressingly smooth mouthfeel that just seduces the palate into submission. Then the deliciousness sinks in, all red currants, cherries, mocha, licorice, pepper and smoke, set off with fine acidity and tannins. So compulsively drinkable, you can't keep your hands off it. Best now through 2010."

The spice from the wood is the dominant factor to begin with, and this needs more time to integrate. But already, the fruit is impressively ripe and jammy, a fruit salad of black and red berry fruits. The tannins are dark, brooding away in the background. Keep this wine at least five years, probably 10."
230022,Pinot Noir,Domaine des Lambrays 2002  Clos de Lambrays,France,NULL,95,2002,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-lambrays-2002-pinot-noir-clos-lambrays/,"An elegant, charming wine that offers structure as well as finesse. The fruits are delicious, perfumed, just maturing into smoky bacon flavors. Dry tannins and red fruits are balanced by fresh acidity."

It is big, muscular, the structure wide and open. It shows richness and opulence, brought into line by a firm, youthful structure that needs five years or more to age."
230223,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Duckhorn 2004 Red Wine Red (Howell Mountain),US,75,95,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/duckhorn-2004-red-wine-napa-howell-mountain/,"Almost entirely Merlot, with a few drops of other Bordeaux varieties, this Howell Mountain red screams for time in the cellar. The tannins bite and dog the mouth through the long, astringent finish. But chew on it for a while and you hit a deep core of blackberries and currants, and the more the wine warms up in the glass, the more impressive it gets. Cellar until 2010, and it should reward for years after."

The fruit smacks of cassis and a bit of boysenberry; the 80% new oak is barely evident. It's got the typical potpourri mix of flower and herb, not just the scents but also in the flavors. The flavors just hang in there remarkably well; this takes cassis and black olive and smoke and tar and mixes them into a tight, compact, layered and lengthy Cabernet."

The cross of flavors is remarkable. These wines change dramatically in the glass and in the bottle; they have so much packed-in flavor that it's almost impossible to nail them down. This is loaded with deep berry fruits, ancient balsamic, cured meat, smoke and chocolate-covered raisins."

Rita Hills),US,80,96,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/sea-smoke-2006-ten-pinot-noir-central-coast-sta-rita-hills/,"Only a Burgundian ideologue would find anything not to like about this mouth-filling Pinot that captures the essence of Santa Rita Hills. It's as voluptuous as any Pinot in California, offering waves of ripe, fleshy cherries, red currants, licorice and smoky vanilla that just don't stop in palate appeal. For all that, the wine is elegant, silky and refined. Delicious now, although a little tannic, and will benefit from decanting and aging. Bring on the steak."
231717,Cabernet Sauvignon,Quilceda Creek 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),US,115,96,2005,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/quilceda-creek-2005-cabernet-sauvignon-columbia-valley-wa/,"Still young, chewy and textural, this stands as a classic Washington 2005 red—lusciously laden with mixed red and black berries, generous and deep; dense and jammy. The mixed berries, red licorice, cherries, layers of butterscotch, toffee and caramel are beautifully integrated and linger seductively into the finish. It has some initial alcoholic heat, but the flavors compensate and go on and on. This is a wine that must be cellared another five or more years before it even begins to pull itself together. If you must pop the cork before then, decant it for at least six hours and more if possible before drinking."
231718,Merlot,Leonetti Cellar 2006 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),US,65,96,2006,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/leonetti-cellar-2006-merlot-columbia-valley-wa/,"This bright, aromatic, vivid wine opens with a bowlful of berries and cherries. There is plenty of acid under the ripe fruit, which takes center stage at the moment. The significant addition of Carmenère (from the Seven Hills vineyard) adds black pepper to the engaging mix of flavors. Despite its youth, the flavors persist for a remarkably long finish."

Not the wine-on-steroids that it could be; TNS, made from Touriga Nacional and Syrah, is elegant, sexy and in total control. Floral berry aromas, delicate raspberry flavors and a smooth, lightly oaked finish all help steal the show. Available only in magnums; awesome holiday gift."

And what gorgeous tannins they are, so refined and expressive. The fruit is perfectly ripe, suggesting currants, blackberries, red and black cherries, licorice and a hint of milk chocolate. Rewarding now, and should hold and improve for at least a decade."

Here we're talking about color, bouquet, palate feel, intense flavors, finish, you name it. It's pure, ultratasty, chocolaty, smooth and pleasurable. Astrales is the complete package and a wine to watch."
231707,Pinot Noir,Melville 2006 Estate Carrie's Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),US,52,95,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/melville-2006-estate-carries-pinot-noir-central-coast-sta-rita-hills/,"This is the grandest of Melville's current trio of '06s. It's also the most ageworthy. Fifty percent stem inclusion in the fermentation has given the wine a tannic, gritty earthiness and spiciness that throw a cloak over the underlying wine. But what a fantastic wine that is, loaded with oodles of cherries, currants and violets. Hard to exaggerate the complexity and broad intellectual appeal of this connoisseur's wine."
231709,Cabernet Sauvignon,Marita's Vineyard 2005 Select Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,150,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/maritas-vineyard-2005-select-private-reserve-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"The first sniff and taste tell you this is an important wine, but also a very young, tannic one. It's the structure, and not just the ripe flavors, that's so impeccable, giving the wine its backbone and strength. But speaking of flavors, the wine is gigantic in black currants and blackberries. One hundred percent new French oak is completely in accord with the size. Drink now, with decanting, and through 2015 at least."
231710,Syrah,Failla 2006 Phoenix Ranch Syrah (Napa Valley),US,42,95,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/failla-2006-phoenix-ranch-shiraz-syrah-syrah-napa-valley/,"An awesome Syrah that proves that, while size isn't everything, it does matter. A major league wine, brilliantly packed with currant, black cherry, licorice and pepper flavors whose power is hard to exaggerate. For all that, the wine never loses its balance and sense of proportion. So good now, you won't be able to keep your hands off it, but it should hold for six years."
231712,Cabernet Sauvignon,Nickel &amp; Nickel 2005 John C. Sullenger Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),US,90,96,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/nickel-nickel-2005-john-c-sullenger-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-oakville/,"This is a stunningly powerful 100% Cabernet, rich in fruit and well-oaked, that shows the authority of Oakville in a great vintage. Flooded with cassis, black cherries, dark chocolate and cedar, it's nonetheless too young in brisk tannins to fully express itself. A joy to drink, but needs time. Best after 2009 and for many years after."
231713,Pinot Noir,Etude 2005 Heirloom Pinot Noir (Carneros),US,90,96,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/etude-2005-heirloom-pinot-noir-napa-sonoma-carneros/,"Etude's Heirloom bottling is vintage-driven, and the 2005 is a great wine. It's a powerhouse that in its youth is full-bodied and almost heavy. It shows massive flavors of red currants, cherry pie filling, cola, figs and spices that taste like they were baked into a dessert pastry, except that the finish is thoroughly dry. What's hard to communicate is the wine's dazzling structure. Not meant to be opened now, it's a Pinot Noir to store through 2010, as it husbands its strength and gains bottle complexity."
231714,Cabernet Sauvignon,Far Niente 2005 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),US,125,96,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/far-niente-2005-estate-bottled-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-oakville/,"A fantastic Cabernet that stuns now for authenticity and power, and should develop for many years. Despite the large production, lower than that of many first growth Bordeaux, the wine, which has tiny amounts of Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, shows classic Oakville elegance and precision. Rich in black currants, blackberries, cherries and dark chocolate, it should hit its stride from 2011 through 2017."
231715,Cabernet Sauvignon,Leonetti Cellar 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),US,80,96,2005,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/leonetti-cellar-2005-cabernet-sauvignon-columbia-valley-walla-walla-wa/,"The Cabernet is sharply defined, with interesting citrus flavors defining the borders of the fruit. Lemon peel, candied pineapple and even grapefruit add lovely grace notes indicative of rich, clean, natural acids and a wine with plenty of glycerin. The stunning red fruits are polished and backed with details such as dried herb, and a tiny hint of mint. This may well be the most ageworthy Leonetti Cabernet ever made."
232429,Pinot Noir,Siduri 2006 Truett Nolan Pinot Noir (California),US,68,96,2006,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/siduri-2006-truett-nolan-pinot-noir-other/,"A best-barrel blend of select Sonoma County and Santa Rita Hills vineyards, this is the best Pinot Siduri has ever produced. It has the rich, spicy purity of a fine malt Scotch (however weird that sounds), long and satisfying in clove-accented cherry, black raspberry and peat flavors, smoked on a wood-fired grill. The mouthfeel is dramatic, all satin, silk and velvet, with finely etched tannins. Really a stunning achievement, and with a good 10 years of life ahead."

It shoots off an amazing panoply of flavors—all the density, complexity and detail is maintained at rather high alcohol (15.5%). The fruits run from berries through stone fruits to tropical, woven together into a delicious tangle. This is so compact and distinctive that words fail; it sails through layers and layers of exotic flavors, with the characteristic earthy, funky edge that vigneron Christophe Baron imparts."
232431,Syrah,Cayuse 2004 En Chamberlin Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),US,NULL,96,2004,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/cayuse-2004-en-chamberlin-vineyard-shiraz-syrah-syrah-columbia-valley-walla-walla-wa/,"The salty, saline quality of Spanish wines is here married to New World fruit. There is amazing density, concentration and sweetness to the fruit. Layers of chocolate, prune, fig, herb, cola, butterscotch, balsamic all commingle. This is incredibly complex, yet almost impossible to pin down."
232432,Red Blend,Leonetti Cellar 2005 Reserve Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),US,125,97,2005,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/leonetti-cellar-2005-reserve-red-wine-columbia-valley-walla-walla-wa/,"The 2005 Leonetti Reserve is all estate vineyard fruit—63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot and 20% Petit Verdot. It is saturated and dense. The fruit is dark, smoky, herbal, tight and loaded with licorice, tea leaf, black olive, hints of tar and graphite. Tannins are in perfect proportion, polished and ripe, with extra texture and weight. The finish is granular and detailed, but delicious accent flavors of almond candy and nougat keep piling into the extraordinary finish."
234296,Pinot Noir,Arista 2005 Ferrington Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),US,54,97,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/arista-2005-ferrington-vineyard-pinot-noir-mendocino-lake-counties-anderson-valley/,"Showing the superb structure of the vintage and the spectacular way this great vineyard can ripen Pinot Noir, this polished wine is not only delicious from the get-go, but ageable. Floods the mouth with lush black cherry, red currant, cola, sweet oak, anise, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors that go on and on. A memorable wine that should slowly gather steam and peak by 2011, then begin a long, steady arc downward."
234297,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stonestreet 2004 Christopher's Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),US,100,97,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/stonestreet-2004-christophers-cabernet-sauvignon-sonoma-alexander-valley/,"This mountain Cab, blended with a little Petit Verdot and Syrah, is grown at 2,400 feet in the Mayacamas Mountains, which provide the east wall of Alexander Valley. The wine is known to be an ager, and the '04 should develop for many years. It's a tremendous wine, the equal of almost anything from Napa, which, after all, is just a geographic boundary away. Fabulously concentrated in cassis, currant, smoky cherry, licorice and chocolate flavors, its tannic structure is nearly perfect."
234289,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lancaster 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),US,70,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/lancaster-2005-cabernet-sauvignon-sonoma-alexander-valley/,"A massive wine that absolutely demands time in the cellar, Lancaster's '05 is nearly all Cabernet, with tiny amounts of the other four Bordeaux varieties. It stuns with the power and authenticity of its hilly Cabernet origins, offering vast black currant, orange rind, anise and smoky oak flavors that implode on the palate. But the tannins are hard. It should blossom and fully come into its own after 2010."
235139,Pinot Noir,Kynsi 2005 Stone Corral Vineyard Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),US,45,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/kynsi-2005-stone-corral-vineyard-pinot-noir-central-coast-edna-valley/,"An enormously opulent wine, brimming with gobs of red cherries, currants, mocha, clove, cinnamon and pepper flavors. Impresses for the lushness and integrity of the structure. Brilliant wine, just gorgeous, a real crowd-pleaser. With its recent track record, Kynsi enters the front ranks of California Pinot Noir producers."

The vintage was California's finest ever, and the wine shows spectacularly ripe red currant, cherry, tangerine zest, licorice and beef jerky flavors, with just the right touch of smoky oak. Yet the structural balance of acidity and fine tannins gives it the perfect architecture. Best now in its flashy youth and for the next 4 or 5 years."
235596,Pinot Noir,Louis Jadot 2005  Clos de la Roche,France,138,98,2005,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/louis-jadot-2005-pinot-noir-clos-roche/,"This is a powerhouse of a wine. It is driven forward by immense tannins as well as by superrich fruit that still keeps itself in check by a velvet texture. There is spice, acidity, some toast and vanilla, and finally a sunburst of warmth."
235849,Red Blend,Betz Family 2005 Clos de Betz Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),US,40,95,2005,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/betz-family-2005-clos-red-wine-columbia-valley-wa/,"The 2005 Clos de Betz explodes from the glass with profound scents of pipe tobacco, violets, cherries and clove. Immediately supple and silky, this delicious blend of 56% Merlot, 19% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Malbec and 9% Cabernet Franc offers more complexity than any Clos de Betz to date. Silky, tightly packed fruit flavors are seamlessly blended, with berries, currants and cherries galore. The tannins have been buffed to a fine lustre."

This wine dazzles with exotic, feral notes of wild blackberries and blueberries, and forest scents of pine needle, roasted mushroom, grilled meat, chocolate, anise, cinnamon, nutmeg and coriander. New oak adds even richer nuances of smoky caramel and vanilla to this compelling wine."
235879,Pinot Noir,Louis Jadot 2005  Charmes-Chambertin,France,134,98,2005,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/louis-jadot-2005-pinot-noir-charmes-chambertin/,"A complete wine. As it starts in the mouth, there is a feeling of everything in its place. The tannins are initially soft, dusty rather than dry; then the dark plums, red berries and so-sweet strawberries come into play. And finally, they all come together in a climax of richness and freshness."
235856,Pinot Noir,Louis Jadot 2005 Clos Saint Jacques Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),France,125,96,2005,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/louis-jadot-2005-clos-saint-jacques-premier-cru-pinot-noir-gevrey-chambertin/,"Beautiful, aromatic wine, with raspberry fruit floating above the spice and toast. This is shot through with acidity and some dense tannins, but above all it is the piercing fruit that dominates. One of Jadot's signature wines, it is wonderful, with considerable aging potential."
235858,Red Blend,Betz Family 2005 Le Parrain Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),US,85,96,2005,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/betz-family-2005-le-parrain-red-wine-columbia-valley-wa/,"Bob Betz calls this his first-ever “reserve style” wine from Bordeaux varieties. It started with a single barrel of Red Willow Cabernet Franc and evolved into this six-barrel blend. Le Parrain opens with whiffs of smoke, gun metal and rock weaving through the dense red fruits. Pipe tobacco and licorice flavors come into play from the barrel aging. As the wine slowly opens, the flavors expand and blend, and the textural quality that Betz refers to expresses itself in a graceful, three-dimensional finish."
235859,Cabernet Sauvignon,Betz Family 2005 Père de Famille Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),US,55,97,2005,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/betz-family-2005-pere-famille-cabernet-sauvignon-columbia-valley-wa/,"The fragrance is almost otherworldly; sweet, dense and lightly lifted. This is a sinewy wine, that begins with compact power and focused, tart red fruits—predominantly raspberry and currant. At first juicy and tart, with hours of breathing time the wine broadens out into a wider spectrum of Cabernet fruits; cassis, blackberry and black cherry."
235860,Pinot Noir,Louis Jadot 2005  Corton-Pougets,France,95,97,2005,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/louis-jadot-2005-pinot-noir-corton-pougets/,"A supremely integrated wine, its richness and beautiful fruit just part of a story that starts with intense aromas and segues on the palate into a balance of tannins, dark red fruits, enveloping acidity and a beautifully orchestrated finale of berries, spice and aching freshness."

Its intense fruit is balanced and harmonizes well with the sweet tannins, the layers of wood and the red berry flavors. Certainly powerful, it impresses equally with the pleasure it will give in 7–10 years."

The bouquet is round and deep, with alluring cola, mint and blackberry aromas. The palate is alive but still quite dark, with huge black plum and blackberry flavors. Super long on the finish, with a subtle streak of vanilla and coconut. Delicious but also deft. 450 cases produced."

It comes from the soft richness of the generous fruit, the spice from both the wood and the fruit, and the roundness of the texture, which envelops you in its warmth and ripeness. And, at the end, just to give a great lift, along comes the acidity."
235853,Pinot Noir,Standish 2005 Mayflower Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),US,80,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/standish-2005-mayflower-pinot-noir-mendocino-lake-counties-anderson-valley/,"This is the smoothest, most polished of Standish's quartet of new Pinots. It's a best-of-barrels selection, and really impressive in cherry, currant, licorice, cola and Provençal herbs. With near-perfect balance, it exemplifies Anderson Valley and also is a standout in the great 2005 vintage. It was crafted, under Standish's “guest winemaker” program, by Zach Rasmussen, of Goldeneye."

And that might be justified. This is a spectacular wine in every sense of the word. The nose blends alluring scents of smoke, asphalt, rubber and black fruit. The palate is saturated and smooth, with black cherry and blackberry flavors leading the way. Coffee, berry pie and mocha help the finish hold court and then fade away. Already good but best from 2010–2020."

This 2005 shows intense, complex fruits and tannins, both finely intertwined. There is power, but the strawberry flavors are just as important, flattering the palate."

The Meritage labeling identifies it as their supreme bottling of a Bordeaux-style wine. Easily the best Symmetry ever, it is a great wine. Dry and somewhat astringent in tannins, it has an impressively deep core of blackberries and currants, with an array of sweet herbs, chocolate and tobacco. It's delicious now, and should slowly develop bottle complexities over the next 10 years."

Made in traditional open stone fermenters, this is not a modern wine. It's a wine, whose dark tannins and dense fruits demand attention and time. At this stage—six years in—it remains a baby, but in another five years, it will start to be a great wine, one that will show a hedonistic mix of power and beauty."

Waves of cherries, raspberries, roasted hazelnuts, cola, pomegranates, herb tea, dusty Asian spices and smoky oak change constantly in the glass, as the wine breathes and endlessly fascinates. Bone-dry and tartly crisp, the wine will develop bottle complexities over the next eight years."
236635,Pinot Noir,Goldeneye 2005 Confluence Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),US,75,96,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/goldeneye-2005-confluence-vineyard-pinot-noir-mendocino-lake-counties-anderson-valley/,"The vineyard has been the source to some of Goldeneye's deepest, most profound wines, and the '05 certainly is big and cellar-worthy. It's somewhat tannic, and very deep in black cherries and blackberries, with rich complexities of figs, dusty spices and smoky oak. The power of this wine is considerable, yet it somehow retains the light silkiness of great Pinot Noir."
237341,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Haut-Brion 2005  Pessac-Léognan,France,1500,98,2005,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-haut-brion-2005-red-pessac-leognan/,"A big, virile wine, dominated by dark and firm tannins. The structure comes from powerful black fruits, the wood only showing as dry edge to the tannins. It's firm, obviously destined for long aging, with initial blackberry fruits powering through the density. A stupendous wine that will last many decades."
237523,Tinta de Toro,Maurodos 2004 San Román  (Toro),Spain,50,95,2004,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/maurodos-2004-san-roman-tempranillo-tinta-de-toro-toro/,"About as good as it gets in terms of a powerful, fully oaked modern wine that still guards its core identity while offering plenty of straightforward drinking pleasure. San Roman in 2004 is a high-speed train with agile fruit and bracing acidity more dominating than, say, tannic might or alcoholic heat. Among the brave new world of modern wines from Toro this is one of the very best. 6,500 cases produced."
237524,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Colgin 2005 Cariad Red (Napa County),US,NULL,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/colgin-2005-cariad-red-napa-county/,"Cariad is an interesting Bordeaux blend, the '05 consisting of Cab Sauvignon, Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot. It feels a little tentative now, as if the components are still learning how to mesh. There's a shy, tannic quality to the cherry, currant, chocolate and plum flavors, and a glyceriney mouthfeel that makes the wine slippery smooth. Give it a few years of cellaring, and it should perform well through 2017, at least."
237514,Cabernet Sauvignon,Charles Creek 2004 La Vista Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,55,95,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/charles-creek-2004-vista-stagecoach-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"This is a deft Cabernet, the opposite of the modern cult style, better defined by what it is not. It's a brilliantly structured wine, with a firm architecture of tannins and acids. The flavors of blackberries, currants, cedar and spice are deeply satisfying. Drink now and for the next six years."
237515,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Kendall-Jackson 2003 Stature Red (Napa Valley),US,95,95,2003,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/kendall-jackson-2003-stature-red-napa-valley/,"Stature is K-J's top Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, and can come from any of the winery's vineyards. The '03 hails from Atlas Peak, Mount Veeder and Knights Valley. The wine is immaculate and impeccable, with impressive black currant, cedar, pencil lead and smoky vanilla aromas and flavors that finish with a great deal of complexity and interest. So balanced, so lush, it just dazzles. Drink now through 2012 or thereabouts. Winery only."

Almost too rich, too New World, but you have to be impressed by the aromatic intensity of the black fruits, the dense, firm tannins, and the superripe black juice and licorice flavors. The wood is still too overpowering and needs time to settle in."
237517,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Hosanna 2005  Pomerol,France,200,95,2005,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-hosanna-2005-red-pomerol/,"Everything is here in this great wine. The solid fruit flavors are of black berries and dried raisins, and there is a rich, powerful structure. Above all, it is finely balanced. It shows that a wine can be powerful without being high alcohol."

There's a sense of authority here, from a wine that has all the elements in the right place. Wait at least 10 years."

It's closed and tannic now, in the manner of Howell Mountain Cabs, but enormous in ripe black currant fruit, with the power and focus to age for many years. Best after 2009 and through 2017, but only with impeccable cellar conditions."
237522,Cabernet Sauvignon,Barnett 2005 Rattlesnake Hill Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),US,120,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/barnett-2005-rattlesnake-hill-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-spring-mountain/,"Rattlesnake Hill is on the estate, more than 2,000 feet up in the Mayacamas above St. Helena. Typically tannic, in the way of Spring Mountain Cabs, the '05 is a dramatically structured wine that dazzles with power. Made entirely from Cabernet Sauvignon, it shows classic varietal flavors of black currants, cherries, licorice and spices, while mostly new French oak adds the perfect facade of smoky wood. Fabulous now with decanting and over rich fare such as steak, the wine should age gracefully for at least a decade."
237536,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château La Mission Haut-Brion 2005  Pessac-Léognan,France,1500,97,2005,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-mission-haut-brion-2005-red-pessac-leognan/,"Dark and dense, but with such opulent fruit, this is a year when La Mission shows its softer, richer side by comparison with neighbor Haut-Brion. There is spice and exotic and generous red fruits to give with the concentration. It has great power, but it also has a velvet structure."
237537,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Léoville Barton 2005  Saint-Julien,France,150,97,2005,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-leoville-barton-2005-red-saint-julien/,"Power and elegance merge effortlessly in this superb wine.

But this is also finely structured and dense, with tannins that are sweet, flavors of dark chocolate to go with the roundness and the enticing Cabernet Franc perfumes. In all, this is a great wine, with considerable aging potential, but with enough sweet fruit to make it attractive now."
237539,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Colgin 2005 IX Estate Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),US,275,97,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/colgin-2005-ix-estate-red-wine-napa-valley/,"This Bordeaux blend is similar to Colgin's Cariad bottling, but the grapes are from the winery's estate vineyard, high up on Pritchard Hill, ranging in elevation from 1,100–1,300 feet. A distinct note of violets and Provençal herbs erupts from the glass, supported by fruiter ones of cherries, red and black currants, dark chocolate, caramelized oak and cedar. What is so masterful about the wine is its complex structure. The tannins are fine as can be, offering just the right quality of briskness, and balanced with vital acidity. Tasted alongside Colgin's other 2005 wines, the IX Estate surpasses them all in sheer power and depth. Drink now, with decanting, or cellar through 2020."
237540,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Cos d'Estournel 2005  Saint-Estèphe,France,250,97,2005,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-cos-destournel-2005-red-saint-estephe/,"Saint-Estèphe has a reputation for tannins, and this 2005 Cos lives up to that. But it does much more, because the tannins add richness along with intensely ripe black fruits, dark plums and figs. The dense tannins are finely balanced with fresh acidity, and a long-lasting aftertaste. Impressive."
237541,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Margaux 2005  Margaux,France,NULL,98,2005,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-margaux-2005-red-margaux/,"For a Château Margaux, this is an especially rich wine. The dense fruit, superripe but not overpowering, and the blackberry jam flavors show the richness of the year. There is wood alongside the juiciness and sweet tannins. Of course, it will age, but it's so delicious to drink now."

But then it becomes apparent that this is beautifully integrated and balanced, bringing together power, with the hallmark Lafite style and poise. In the end, you have a wine that promises an impressive aging potential along with delicious black currant fruits, acidity and a layer of striking tannins. Imported by Domaines Barons de Rothschild and multiple U.S. importers."

The core of richness, the dense, bone-dry tannins, the black currants, red berries and black plum skins are the elements, but it's the way they have been integrated that makes this such an impressive wine. There is great elegance as well, a fabulous counterpoint to such power. Cellar for at least 15 years, but this will keep forever. Imported by Diageo Chateau &amp; Estates and multiple U.S. importers."
237544,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Pétrus 2005  Pomerol,France,6000,100,2005,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-petrus-2005-red-pomerol/,"As so often, Pétrus has the ability to charm and impress, to seduce and overwhelm. This 2005, one of the greatest vintages from this great chateau, is massive and concentrated, with flavors of ripe black figs, chocolate and dark plums. Put that all together and the result is the utmost deliciousness, freshness and elegance. A major wine. Imported by Etablissements Jean-Pierre Moueix."

Beneath this elegant exterior, there is also power from intensely concentrated fruit and tannins. The wine is already well integrated, the wood only here by feel, balancing so well with the fruit. To finish, sweet fruit and dusty tannins combine easily."

This 100% Cabernet is stunning, a quintessential hillside Cab that's powerful and compelling in blackberries, red and black currants, cola, spices and cedar. It feels ultra-refined in the mouth, with slightly tough tannins and a trace of acidity giving a sturdy structure. Decant this great wine if you open it now, and it should evolve for a good 15 years in the cellar."

The center is round, but dark, filled with sweetness; the outer layers are full of red jelly and toast. There are tannins, but they, too, are sweet."

It is coming together into a wine that will be big and dense, but never over the top."

But the smoothness of the ripe black fruits as they combine with the beautifully judged wood show a contrast of tension with the dense, chewy core. At its heart, this wine is dark and solid and concentrated, promising long aging."

Although the tannins are  ripe and sweet, they still possess enough astringency to suggest cellaring. This wine is terrifically rich in black currants and exotic, smoky oak—a big, rich Cab whose impeccable structure defines Oakville. Unfined and unfiltered, it will be best after 2008 and through 2017."

Based on Cabernet, with small quantities of Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, it has oak-influenced black and red currant, cassis, cherry, spicy plum pudding and sweet, smoky vanilla flavors, with a cedar, pencil-lead note reminiscent of a fine Pauillac. Lush now, it should develop well through 2015."

Cascading flavors of black cherry, plum and cassis are drenched in caramel, mocha and buttery barrel flavors. Although the wine lists at a hefty 14.9% alcohol, it does not sacrifice elegance, nor does it substitute power for polish. The rush of blueberry, blackberry, black cherry and currant fruit, the layers of smoke and graphite, and the immense barrel flavors just keep on rolling through the palate. It will probably age quite well, but why wait?"

The blackberry, cherry, cassis and chocolate flavors have all kind of overtones, ranging from licorice and vanilla to gingerbread and candied violets. Saxum has become a cult favorite, one of the highest-priced brands from Paso Robles, and wines like this are the reason why. Drink now and through 2008. Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache."

It's an important addition to the Alexander Valley pantheon, a densely layered young wine.

239071,Red Blend,Podere Sapaio 2004 Sapaio  (Bolgheri Superiore),Italy,66,95,2004,Tuscany,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/podere-sapaio-2004-sapaio-red-bolgheri-superiore/,"Not bad for a first attempt. This is a thick, dark wine of almost impenetrable extraction and mature fruit notes of black cherry and black currant. Its aromas are painted in broad brush strokes and invoke roasted espresso bean, black chocolate and smoked game. It has an outstanding mouthfeel, with voluptuous but solid tannins and enormous length. Drink after 2015."
239072,Sangiovese,San Giusto a Rentennano 2004 Percarlo Sangiovese (Toscana),Italy,70,95,2004,Tuscany,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/san-giusto-a-rentennano-2004-percarlo-sangiovese-toscana/,"Percarlo is an outstandingly intense and complex Sangiovese that is true to its Tuscan roots. Aromas are wide and penetrating and span the gamut of balsam possibilities, voluptuous fruit, lead pencil and spice. It is round and very fragrant in the mouth with plush smoothness and soft extraction."
239074,Red Blend,Marchesi Antinori 2004 Solaia Red (Toscana),Italy,170,96,2004,Tuscany,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/marchesi-antinori-2004-solaia-red-toscana/,"The 2004 Solaia is dense and concentrated with loads of character and defining aromatics: plump blackberry, chocolate fudge, exotic spice, peppercorn and smooth balsam notes. The real pleasure comes in the mouth where it delivers smooth elegance and an extra long finish."
239075,Sangiovese,Bibi Graetz 2004 Testamatta Sangiovese (Toscana),Italy,98,96,2004,Tuscany,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bibi-graetz-2004-testamatta-sangiovese-toscana/,"A prominent mineral component moves aside after a few minutes to reveal the true treasures of this Sangiovese-Canaiolo blend. Those include the wine's gorgeous renderings of small forest fruit, Spanish cedar, cigar box and rum cake. Breathtaking in evolution and intensity."
239076,Tempranillo,Bodegas Roda 2005 Cirsion  (Rioja),Spain,303,96,2005,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bodegas-roda-2005-cirsion-tempranillo-rioja/,"Jammy, creamy and superripe, with raspberry, burnt toast and coffee on the thick, meaty nose. Flavors reminiscent of an ice cream sundae work the palate, which means berry syrup, chocolate sauce and vanilla are highly prominent. Texturally speaking, this is a smooth, soft and plush wine. It pushes the envelope on ripeness, but that's become the Cirsion way. An awesome wine that deserves a proper decanting."
239077,Cabernet Franc,Le Macchiole 2004 Paleo Cabernet Franc (Toscana),Italy,105,96,2004,Tuscany,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/le-macchiole-2004-paleo-cabernet-franc-toscana/,"This Cabernet Franc is beautiful, with incredible succulence, persistence, heat, power and a full plate of enticing fragrances. Coffee, root beer, chocolate, Nutella, graham cracker and cherry liqueur are only a few elements of the wine's complexity."
239078,Merlot,Fattoria Petrolo 2004 Galatrona Merlot (Toscana),Italy,100,97,2004,Tuscany,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/fattoria-petrolo-2004-galatrona-merlot-toscana/,"Galatrona is one of Italy's top Merlots and 2004 is its best vintage yet. The mouthfeel is extraordinary, distinguished by spectacular smoothness and elegance: The wine drinks like a chiaroscuro painting where all elements are harmonious by design. And there's excellent dimension with vibrant tones of red fruit and sweet spice woven within its fruity fabric."
239079,Red Blend,Tenuta San Guido 2004 Sassicaia  (Bolgheri Sassicaia),Italy,190,97,2004,Tuscany,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/tenuta-san-guido-2004-sassicaia-red-bolgheri-sassicaia/,"The best Sassicaia of the last 10 years, the 2004 vintage is an outstanding achievement. Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc highlight the beauty of Tuscany and portray the region in terms of thick chocolate fudge, succulent cherry and currant, exotic spice and vanilla seed. Beyond those big aromas are little teasers: blue flowers, Mediterranean herbs, cola and light mineral shadings. It's lush and full in the mouth and will hold 20 or 30 years."
239080,Merlot,Tenuta dell'Ornellaia 2004 Masseto Merlot (Toscana),Italy,250,99,2004,Tuscany,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/tenuta-dellornellaia-2004-masseto-merlot-toscana/,"Even better than the highly acclaimed 2001 vintage, this Merlot from a tiny, clay soil vineyard in Bolgheri is just about everything you've ever dreamed of tasting. Gorgeous, generous, voluptuous, cheerful, succulent and intense: Masseto is all those things. The aromas are seamless and capture the essence of chocolate fudge, sweet cherry, blackberry, spice and vanilla. It boasts thick, dense extraction, excellent structure and amazing persistence."
239694,Syrah,Novy 2005 Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),US,27,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/novy-2005-shiraz-syrah-syrah-central-coast-santa-lucia-highlands/,"Dark and racy, with a Northern Rhône-style aroma of black pepper, cedar and black currants, but there's nothing Rhône-like about the flavor. It's distinctly California, with soft, sweetly ripe tannins bursting with blackberry jam, black currants, anise, vanilla and sweet oak flavors. The wine is fully dry. Absolutely first-rate Syrah."
239696,Pinot Noir,Faiveley 2005 Clos des Cortons  (Corton),France,195,95,2005,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/faiveley-2005-clos-cortons-pinot-noir-corton/,"One of Faiveley's monopoles (wholly owned vineyards), Clos des Cortons makes powerful wines. That's the case in 2005. This wine towers up, a strong edifice of tannins and big, black fruits. It has all the right elements coming into place, along with weight and some elegance."
239697,Sangiovese,Poggio Nardone 2001 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),Italy,60,95,2001,Tuscany,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/poggio-nardone-2001-riserva-sangiovese-brunello-montalcino/,"A liquid lullaby more than a wine, this Brunello caresses and smoothes over your senses with amazing intensity and harmonious aromas of cherry-chocolate fudge, almond paste, ginger, balsamic notes, blueberry pie, firewood and vanilla. There's a shroud of cedar and cherry fruit within the wine's unwavering structure and a seemingly endless finish."
239698,Sangiovese,Biondi Santi 2001 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),Italy,400,96,2001,Tuscany,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/biondi-santi-2001-riserva-sangiovese-brunello-montalcino/,"Immediately, you know you are before a great Brunello with bright fruit aromas backed by forest floor, balsam notes, bramble, blue flowers, red apple and mint. The presence of wood is all but invisible and the wine sings true to its territory and tradition. The wine's natural acidity and intensity promise a long and glorious aging future before it."
239699,Cabernet Sauvignon,Shafer 2003 Hillside Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),US,200,96,2003,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/shafer-2003-hillside-select-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-stags-leap-district/,"Solidly in the Hillside Select model, this vigorous young Cab is dramatically ripe and powerful. The flavors of red and black currants, milk chocolate, figs and smoky vanilla erupt in the mouth, making the tastebuds jump with joy. However, there is also the structure, among the greatest in California Cabs. The acidity is fine, but the tannins are stupendously rich, sweet and complex, practically a food group in themselves. Stunning and gorgeous now in its youth, this collectible wine will reward at least through 2015."
239700,Pinot Noir,Ojai 2005 Fe Ciega Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),US,56,96,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/ojai-2005-fe-ciega-vineyard-pinot-noir-central-coast-sta-rita-hills/,"This wine is as fine as anything from Santa Rita Hills. Although it's young and tight now, its future is assured by the brilliant combination of audacious fruit and classic structure. The blackberry, currant, cherry, anise and clove flavors are wrapped into rich, silky tannins, and brightened with crisp acidity. Best now, with decanting, and for the next 6–8 years."
239701,Pinot Noir,Talley 2005 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),US,70,97,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/talley-2005-rosemarys-vineyard-pinot-noir-central-coast-arroyo-grande-valley/,"This is a great 2005 Pinot Noir, the best ever from Talley. The wine somehow combines huge ripe fruit with delicacy. It floods the mouth with profound currant, cherry pie, licorice, cola, raspberry, cocoa and vanilla smoke flavors, yet feels light and silky, and is thoroughly dry. That's the magic of Pinot Noir. You can enjoy this small production wine now, and it should develop additional complexities for 10 years."
240772,Pinot Noir,Hanzell 2004 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Valley),US,90,95,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/hanzell-2004-pinot-noir-sonoma-valley/,"Among California's First Growth Pinots, Hanzell's ‘04 is marked by a full-bodied, austere density that demands time in the cellar. It's a very dry, fairly tannic wine, rich in ripe crushed black cherry, red cherry candy, tobacco, cedar and spicebox aromas and flavors that are impeccably balanced. Really defines the terroir of the estate, and should develop well. Best 2010 through 2020."
240773,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pride Mountain 2004 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma-Napa),US,120,95,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/pride-mountain-2004-reserve-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-sonoma-napa/,"Youthful tannins star in this young wine. The wine is dry and balanced, with a fabulous core of blackberry, cassis and smoky oak. With a drop of Petite Verdot, which adds a touch of violets, this is one of the best high mountain Cabs of the vintage. Too dry and toughly astringent to drink before 2010;  should develop well through 2016, at least."
240774,Cabernet Sauvignon,Joseph Phelps 2004 Backus Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),US,200,95,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/joseph-phelps-2004-backus-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-oakville/,"It's impossible for a Cabernet to be richer, more opulent or more hedonistically stunning on opening than this beauty from veteran Phelps. Admittedly, there are significant tannins. But the wine delivers a broadside of the sweetest, ripest cassis fruit imaginable, along with richly toasted oak. It's the kind of Cab that will dazzle even an amateur. Absolutely gorgeous now, with immaculate elegance. About the only criticism you can offer is that the structure is a bit obvious, and ageability may be limited."
240779,Pinot Noir,Etude 2005 Temblor Pinot Noir (Carneros),US,60,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/etude-2005-temblor-pinot-noir-napa-sonoma-carneros/,"This is Etude's inaugural bottling of this wine, a block designation from the estate. It shows not only classic Carneros quality, but something exotic. Dry and complex, the wine has cherry, cassis, raspberry and new oak flavors, with good acidity. That extra something is a feral, earthy quality, suggesting olive tapenade, sweet leather, tobacco and mushrooms that has got to come from terroir. Youthfully great now, and should age effortlessly for the next 8 to 10 years."
240780,Cabernet Sauvignon,Corison 2003 Kronos Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,98,95,2003,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/corison-2003-kronos-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"If you choose one wine to stick in the cellar from the '03 vintage, make it this one. It's so dry, balanced and complex, yet so tannicly tough now, that it demands a good 6 years, at a minimum. The heart of blackberries and red currants is opulently rich, with overtones of cedar, pencil lead, red licorice and sweet dried herbs. Brings to mind a classic Rutherford Cab. As delicious as the wine is now, especially with decanting, it really will benefit from aging."
240781,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem 2005 Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),US,75,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/williams-selyem-2005-rochioli-riverblock-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"This is always one of Williams Selyem's most complex, interesting wines. The ‘05 is especially layered, showing a silky, elegant mouthfeel that frames extraordinarily lush flavors of cherries, cola, pomegranates, root beer and dusty Asian spices. Dry and elegant, it's a gorgeous Pinot Noir now, and should develop bottle complexity through 2015."
240782,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem 2005 Flax Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),US,54,96,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/williams-selyem-2005-flax-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"A brilliant young Pinot that magically combines instant drinkability with ageworthiness. Silky and supple, the wine has broad, deep raspberry, cherry, cola, cocoa and spice flavors that are wrapped into sweet, fine tannins, leading to a long, complicated finish. Just gorgeous from the first sniff to the last sip, and should age well through 2015."
240784,Pinot Noir,Sineann 2006 Resonance Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),US,72,96,2006,Oregon,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/sineann-2006-resonance-reserve-pinot-noir-willamette-valley/,"This is Sineann's first reserve, a limited release from some old vine blocks from one of Oregon's greatest Pinot vineyards, now fully biodynamic. As good as the “regular” Resonance is, this ramps it up another notch or two. The fruit ranges from cherry to prune; the acids are perfect, the barrel notes so well-concealed that you cannot separate them out. Streaks of cherry, fig, coffee, smoke, chocolate, bourbon, caramel—where do you stop? It just goes and goes. Phenomenal winemaking."
240785,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem 2005 Allen Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),US,78,96,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/williams-selyem-2005-allen-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"Dry and focused in acids, the wine shows the balance and complexity of the vineyard, as well as its ageworthiness. It's very young now, with immature raspberry, cola, rum punch, balsamic, mushroom and Asian spice flavors, but decanting and slow warming in the glass help elevate it. Nonetheless, your best bet is the cellar. Best after 2008, and for many years after, depending on how old you like your wines."
240786,Pinot Noir,Roessler 2005 Clos Pepe Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),US,50,96,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/roessler-2005-clos-pepe-vineyard-pinot-noir-central-coast-sta-rita-hills/,"Clos Pepe is one of those vineyards that rarely fails to dazzle, and Roessler has done as good a job at interpreting it as any of the wineries that designate its fruit. The wine shows a terrific balance of acids, oak and tannins, with an elegantly silky texture and exquisitely ripe, but controlled, cherry, pomegranate, cola, tea and Asian spice flavors that finish with a lip-smacking, chalky minerality."
240787,Pinot Noir,Etude 2005 Deer Camp Pinot Noir (Carneros),US,60,96,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/etude-2005-deer-camp-pinot-noir-napa-sonoma-carneros/,"This is one for the cellar. Dry and savory, it shows powerfully ripe blackberry, cherry, cassis and coffee flavors that have been well oaked, and the silky, elegant texture of Pinot Noir. But there's a youthful tightness that withholds the wine's tender heart. Best after 2008, and will develop for an additional 6 to 10 years."
240788,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem 2005 Precious Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),US,85,97,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/williams-selyem-2005-precious-mountain-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-coast/,"This is among the lightest in color of Williams Selyem's ‘05 Pinots, and also the most delicate in texture. But yields were very low, and the wine has a fantastically concentrated taste of wild raspberries, as well as crisp, stimulating acidity. Despite the elegance, it's enormously complex, with tiers of oak-influenced cola, herb tea, pomegranate, vanilla and Asian spice flavors. Gorgeous now, this very great Pinot should develop well in the bottle over the next decade."
240842,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Joseph Phelps 2004 Insignia Red (Napa Valley),US,200,97,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/joseph-phelps-2004-insignia-red-napa-valley/,"Tasted in October, 2007, the wine was mute, offering little aromatically except for teasing notes of blackberries and oak. That shyness extended to the taste, where strong, hard tannins provide an almost impenetrable coat of armor to what's inside. But right down the middle of the palate is a deep, intensely powerful stream of perfectly ripened cassis that's all the proof you need of ageability. This is a magnificently structured young wine, reminiscent of a fine young Pauillac. Best after 2012, and should have another decade after that, at least."
240776,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem 2005 Ferrington Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),US,59,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/williams-selyem-2005-ferrington-vineyard-pinot-noir-mendocino-lake-counties-anderson-valley/,"Even in its extreme youth, this lovely Pinot shows a supple elegance that's almost drinkable now. Almost, but not quite. The tannins are ripe and smooth but thick, and the young raspberry, cherry and tangerine fruit needs time to develop and mesh with the oak. But it's a beautiful wine, Williams Selyem's best Ferrington in memory, and a near-perfect expression of Anderson Valley Pinot Noir. Hold until late 2008."
241126,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Branaire-Ducru 2001  Saint-Julien,France,60,95,2001,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-branaire-ducru-2001-red-saint-julien/,"This is a marvelously complete wine, with its impressive ripe fruit, shining through the open structure. It is firm, but not too much. Stone black fruits are just perfectly ripe. There is just a core of dryness to compliment the rest of the wine."
241237,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sineann 2005 Block One Champoux Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (OR)),US,72,95,2005,Oregon,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/sineann-2005-block-one-champoux-vineyard-cabernet-sauvignon-other-columbia-valley-or/,"Fermented to a plus-size 15.4% alcohol, this rare wine from one of Washington's oldest and best Cabernet vineyards shows what a gifted winemaker can do with great fruit. The play of flavors, mixing red and purple fruits, toasted nuts, mocha, caramel, bark and earth, is exceptional. The detail is extraordinary for a wine with such high alcohol. The acids and tannins are seamless and fine, and the flavors extend into an unusual finish that suggests menthol and eucalyptus – not generally a character found in Champoux fruit. All in all it's a wonderful voyage, and one of a handful of essential Washington wines."
241248,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Léoville Barton 2001  Saint-Julien,France,90,96,2001,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-leoville-barton-2001-red-saint-julien/,"A wonderfully firm, concentrated wine that walks a fine, balanced line between richness and poised structure. It is classic in the best sense, showing all the shape of a fine Bordeaux, while adding the extra dimension of the freshest of black fruits, complexity from a few hints of wood, and a dark, brooding, long-lasting aftertaste."
241240,Merlot,Duckhorn 2004 Estate Grown Merlot (Napa Valley),US,85,95,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/duckhorn-2004-estate-grown-merlot-napa-valley/,"A blend of four vineyards, this is an extremely impressive Merlot. It dazzles with rich, ripe black currant, cherry liqueur, raspberry, milk chocolate, smoky oak and spice flavors that are complex and go on and on through the finish. Beyond that is the texture, so refined and elegant, combining power and subtle elegance. Just a gorgeous, sensual Merlot. Drink now–2010."
241251,Pinot Noir,Goldeneye 2004 The Narrows Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),US,70,96,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/goldeneye-2004-narrows-vineyard-pinot-noir-mendocino-lake-counties-anderson-valley/,"This luscious Pinot shows the appellation's ability to perfectly ripen the fruit while maintaining complete balance. The flavors are of cherries, raspberries, currants and cola, with nuances of licorice and gingerbread, yet for all that the finish is totally dry. So powerful is the wine in itself that it easily shoulders the 100% new French oak, which pushes the richness into a smoky, ne plus ultra territory. As for the mouthfeel, it's silky, racy, voluptuous and delicate at the same time, the hallmarks of the very finest California Pinot Noirs."
241255,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Léoville Las Cases 2001  Saint-Julien,France,190,97,2001,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-leoville-las-cases-2001-red-saint-julien/,"A classic in development, a wine that will last for decades. It is certainly powerful, but already the shape is finalized, with its plums and berries settling down with perfumes, acidity, just enough tannins and a warm, welcoming richness. A great argument for the superiority of 2001 over 2000."
241241,Cabernet Sauvignon,Baldacci 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),US,55,95,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/baldacci-2004-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-stags-leap-district/,"This is Baldacci's regular Cab, although most wineries would be content for it to be their reserve. It's a powerful, rich young wine, massive in blackberry, currant and oak flavors, with a succulent edge of milk chocolate. The tannins are pure Stags Leap, giving a complex contrapuntal balance of grip and structure to the opulent fruit. Just fabulous in every aspect, a wine to dazzle. Drink now through 2010, at least."
241242,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Léoville Poyferré 2001  Saint-Julien,France,80,95,2001,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-leoville-poyferre-2001-red-saint-julien/,"The completeness of 2001, with its miraculous balance, is present in this wine. The acidity, ripe blackcurrants sit comfortably on top of dry tannins, the fleshiness of the fruit taking the edge off the tannins. It seems to bring out the structure, the fruit and the refreshing acidity of great Cabernet."
241245,Pinot Noir,Sea Smoke 2005 Southing Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),US,50,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/sea-smoke-2005-southing-pinot-noir-central-coast-sta-rita-hills/,"The most balanced of Sea Smoke's three new Pinots, Southing was aged in about two-thirds new oak, which gives rich caramel, toasted coconut and exotic spice notes to the ripe fruit flavors. The wine explodes with cherries, raspberries, mulberries and even chocolate mint, finishing long and spicy, and leaving the impression of wholesomeness and completeness. Now showing its peak of youthful vivacity, this should develop for an additional six years."
241246,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Quintessa 2004 Red (Rutherford),US,125,95,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/quintessa-2004-red-napa-rutherford/,"A dramatic young wine, fleshy and dazzling now for its lush fruit and oak, although the tannins have a crunchy hardness. But that merely ensures ageability. It's beautiful the way the acid-tannin structure plays against the cherry, cassis and olive fruit, creating an architectural tension. If you open this wine now, decant for a few hours. Otherwise, it should hold for six to eight years, and develop further bottle complexity afterward."
241247,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beaulieu Vineyard 2004 Georges de Latour Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),US,95,95,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/beaulieu-vineyard-2004-georges-latour-private-reserve-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-valley/,"BV Private Reserve has been on a real roll. This Georges is enormous and impressive, gigantic in fruit, explosive in blackberry tart, cherry pie, blueberry, plum, cigar box and vanilla aromas and flavors. Structurally, it's an impeccable wine, showing the fine acidity and firm, dusty tannins that always constitute Georges. Beautiful now, and should age well for 10–20 years, in a cool cellar."
242337,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,BOND 2004 St. Eden Red (Napa Valley),US,210,96,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bond-2004-st-eden-red-napa-valley/,"Brilliant aromatics here, just stupendously attractive. Among the sweetest and most approachable of Harlan's current stable, it's also complex and ageworthy. Fairly tannic now, with a refined sandpapery grittiness coating pure flavors of ripe cherries, plums and blackberries and their associated liqueurs. The finish is so long, balanced and harmonious. It's hard to imagine that this won't be one to age 12–15 years."
242811,Corvina,Bertani 1998  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Italy,70,95,1998,Veneto,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bertani-1998-red-amarone-della-valpolicella-classico/,"There's a particular elegance here that is impossible to beat: The wine is spectacular overall, but never too ornate, and earns high praise for its purity. Aromas of resin, tar, apple and almond are distinct and vibrant and the wine delivers firm, dusty tannins and excellent length."
242338,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate 2005 Doña Margarita Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),US,45,96,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/marimar-estate-2005-dona-margarita-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-coast/,"I love this wine for its balance and dryness. The texture is velvety-silky and gently tannic, while the flavors are complex, suggesting red cherries with the astringent skins, mashed black raspberries, tangerines, cola, root beer, dark unsweetened chocolate, a touch of cassis liqueur, and something earthy, like Portobello mushrooms. This is really a gorgeous Pinot Noir that will develop over the next five years or so."
242339,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lancaster 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),US,65,97,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/lancaster-2004-cabernet-sauvignon-sonoma-alexander-valley/,"Lancaster burst on the scene with enormous buzz, perhaps before they had really earned it. Steadily but surely, they've built up the wine, and the '04 is the best ever. It's a gorgeous Cab, softly complex, rich in cassis, cherry, spice and oak flavors anchored with warm, earthy tannins. In fact, the earthiness stands it in good contrast to Napa Valley, making it wholesome and complete."
242340,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,The Maiden 2004 Red (Napa Valley),US,150,97,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/maiden-2004-red-napa-valley/,"The '04 Maiden is very close to Harlan Estate in quality. The Maiden is a touch less elegant; but it is such a wholesome wine, so succulent in blackberry, cassis, licorice, and roasted cedar. The tannins are so regal—even the slight prickle of acidity works for polish. So beautiful now, it's hard to know when to suggest drinking it, but this should easily be a 10–15 year wine."
242341,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Harlan Estate 2004 Red (Napa Valley),US,350,98,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/harlan-estate-2004-red-napa-valley/,"The price is prerelease; it will soar on the aftermarket. This is very great Harlan. It pours dark and saturated, and the tannins are big and sturdy, not aggressive, but sweet and finely ground. Still, they give a hardness to the immaculately ripe fruit that mandates cellaring. The flavors of currants, blackberries, plums, chocolate and cedar are lush, deep and long-lasting, but just a part of the balanced appeal of this young wine. It really defines the exquisite tension between power and elegance. Best after 2008, then for many years."
242817,Pinot Noir,Dutton-Goldfield 2005 Dutton Ranch Freestone Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),US,58,96,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/dutton-goldfield-2005-ranch-freestone-hill-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"This is ageable and enormously complex, and should do very interesting things over the next six years. Right now it is tight and fresh in primary fruits and acidity. It's an enormously rich wine, vast in black cherries, pomegranates, cola, red plums, balsam and sautéed mushroom flavors, with a gamy, forest-floor earthiness. Time in the bottle can only improve it through 2011."
242813,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate 2004 Cristina Don Miguel Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),US,47,95,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/marimar-estate-2004-cristina-don-miguel-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"This is a small production barrel selection from the estate vineyard in Green Valley. It's very rich and quite young, too primary and tannic to drink now, but extraordinarily rich in the cherries, blackberries, blueberries and Asian spices that characterize the estate. Best 2008–2012."

Gianni Masciarelli is a solid and passionate winemaker who has expertly extracted both elegance and complexity: Black cherry, espresso, chocolate and licorice are reinforced by impenetrable concentration, raw intensity, solid tannins and extreme persistency on the finish."

This is one of Italy's iconic wines thanks to the profound purity it delivers with notes of chocolate, leather, cherry, apple, cola and spice. It imparts loads of succulent flavor and is simply beautiful."

It's not just the fruit, which is deeply satisfying in cherries, raspberries, sweet rhubarb pie, blood oranges and juicy pomegranates. It's the structure. Crisp acids and silky tannins create a near-perfect architecture. Elegant and sophisticated, this wine should develop additional complexities for at least six years, with proper cellaring."
243559,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande 2001  Pauillac,France,NULL,95,2001,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-pichon-longueville-comtesse-lalande-2001-red-pauillac/,"The high proportion of Merlot in Pichon Lalande is a good reason why this wine, among the great wines of Pauillac, is always so seductive. This is no exception; it charms as well as excites with vibrant fruits as well as serious, dense tannins and acidity that promise good aging. Give it 7–9 years for full maturity to begin."

Magnificent in color, aroma, depth and texture; it is polished, elegant, firm and confident. Blossom, fruit, herb and barrel aromas are beautifully interwoven. The tightly packed fruit has it all, from red, blue and black berries on to cherry and cassis. The mid-palate, though quite full, is fleshy and tight. The acids are firm but not sour, the tannins fine and smooth and ripe. The finish, still young and compact, hints at an almost existential longevity."
243567,Pinot Noir,Laetitia 2005 Les Galets Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),US,60,96,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/laetitia-2005-galets-pinot-noir-central-coast-arroyo-grande-valley/,"A sensational Pinot Noir for its complexity, ageability and sheer deliciousness. The parts haven't come together yet, but each is great. Smoky new oak dominates, closely followed by enormously ripe crushed cherry, blackberry, pomegranate, cola and mocha flavors. There's a rich tannin-acid structure, and the sweet, spicy oak reprises on the finish. This big, masculine wine needs time to come together. Should open by 2008 and increase in desirability for a number of years."
243568,Cabernet Blend,Leonetti Cellar 2004 Reserve Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),US,110,97,2004,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/leonetti-cellar-2004-reserve-red-columbia-valley-walla-walla-wa/,"100% estate grown, this truly exceptional Cabernet, Merlot and Petit Verdot blend opens with angular, vertical fruit flavors, stacked tightly and detailed with citrus, graphite and chalk. The layered mid-palate mixes grape, berry, cherry and plum, sweet and dense. The oak is applied moderately, not dominating as in past Leonetti reserves. It's a profound wine with a gorgeous, entrancing structure that is barely beginning its evolution. Flavors emerge in surprising succession, like spring wildflowers that pop up overnight. A remarkable achievement, and quite possibly the best wine ever made by Leonetti."
243560,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sineann 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (OR)),US,36,95,2005,Oregon,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/sineann-2005-cabernet-sauvignon-other-columbia-valley-or/,"Fermented to a plus-size 15.4% alcohol, this rare wine from one of Washington's oldest and best Cabernet vineyards shows what a gifted winemaker can do with great fruit. The play of flavors, mixing red and purple fruits, toasted nuts, mocha, caramel, bark and earth, is exceptional. The detail is extraordinary for a wine with such high alcohol. The acids and tannins are seamless and fine, and the flavors extend into an unusual finish that suggests menthol and eucalyptus —not generally a character found in Champoux fruit. All in all it's a wonderful voyage, and one of a handful of essential Washington wines."
243561,Syrah,Signorello 2005 Estate Syrah (Napa Valley),US,36,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/signorello-2005-estate-shiraz-syrah-syrah-napa-valley/,"You don't think of Signorello as a Syrah house, but for years, they've been putting out serious Syrahs, and with the '05 vintage, they certify this tradition. This wine is, in a word, fabulous. It's enormously attractive in well-oaked cassis, plum, leather, cocoa and white pepper aromas and flavors, but that only begins to describe the complexity. The 4% Viognier seems responsible for the bright intrusion of citrusy acidity. As powerful as it is, the wine never loses sight of balance and elegance."
243562,Syrah,K Vintners 2005 The Beautiful Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),US,50,95,2005,Washington,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/k-vintners-2005-beautiful-shiraz-syrah-syrah-columbia-valley-walla-walla-wa/,"‘The Beautiful' lives up to its name and reputation. The aromas shoot from the glass; young, herbal and strikingly peppery. This shows a complexity that is rare outside of France. The flavors run through the entire length of the palate, a fascinating mix of herb, leaf, earth, and tightly wound berry fruit. It's young and crunchy, thought not fleshy, a wine that is a unique combination of masculine and feminine qualities. It should age well for at least a decade."
245166,Pinot Noir,Thomas Fogarty 2004 Rapley Trail Vineyard M Block Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),US,45,95,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/thomas-fogarty-2004-rapley-trail-vineyard-m-block-pinot-noir-central-coast-santa-cruz-mountains/,"This luscious Pinot is impressive now for the power of its black currant, cherry, raspberry, vanilla, cola and Provençal herb flavors, with their firm backbone of acidity. It's the kind of Pinot that dazzles from the first sip to the last, as it evolves in the glass. The tannins are sweet and gentle, but supportive enough to allow this gorgeous wine to age for six to eight years."
245169,Pinot Noir,Bjornstad 2005 Hellenthal Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),US,50,96,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bjornstad-2005-hellenthal-vineyard-pinot-noir-sonoma-coast/,"This Pinot, from former Tandem partner Greg Bjornstad, defines an exotic, almost feral style of Pinot. There's a raw meat, bloody quality to the wild cherry, blackberry, forest floor and cola flavors that finish in a wild dusting of black pepper and Indian spices. Absolutely unique Pinot Noir, tight, minerally and tannic now, but endlessly fascinating. Has the stuff for eight to 10 years."
245161,Pinot Noir,Drew 2005 Fog-Eater Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),US,35,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/drew-2005-fog-eater-pinot-noir-mendocino-lake-counties-anderson-valley/,"Really just about the perfect Anderson Valley Pinot in terms of the beautifully crisp acidity, and the way the wine blasts pure flavors of red cherries, cassis and raspberries across the palate. With 30% new French oak, this opulence is made more exotic with notes of caramel, butterscotch, vanilla and toast. Combines all this massive power with elegant finesse in an effortless way."
245162,Corvina,Le Salette 2003 Pergole Vece  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),Italy,118,95,2003,Veneto,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/le-salette-2003-pergole-vece-red-amarone-della-valpolicella-classico/,"This first-rate Amarone by Franco Scamperle earns an A for typicity and intensity. The aromas are enticing and pristine, with nuances of forest berry, red apple, chocolate, espresso, resin, chopped herbs and cherry pie. It boasts a lively ruby color, spice-driven flavors (the wine ages three years in barrique) and excellent persistence in the mouth."
245163,Pinot Noir,Emeritus 2005 William Wesley Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),US,50,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/emeritus-2005-william-wesley-pinot-noir-sonoma-coast/,"Tasted alongside its Russian River Valley sister bottling, released at the same time, this new wine from Sonoma-Cutrer founder Brice Jones shows far greater power. Just erupts with masses of sweet cherries and raspberries with a liqueur richness, and nuances of forest floor, pine needles and smoky oak. Really notable for balance. Citrusy acids and firm, sweet tannins give this Pinot, from way out on the Far Sonoma Coast, a brilliant structure. Beautiful now and for the next 10 years."
245170,Cabernet Sauvignon,La Jota Vineyard 2002 21st Anniversary Release Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),US,90,96,2002,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/jota-vineyard-2002-21st-anniversary-release-cabernet-sauvignon-napa-howell-mountain/,"Classic Howell Mountain tannins, powerful and focused, but ripely sweet, frame opulent cherry, cassis, plum sauce and new oak flavors, and for all that, there's a crisp edge of acidity that makes everything clean and bright. Drink now through 2012."
245738,Tempranillo,Ostatu 2003 Gloria de Ostatu  (Rioja),Spain,75,95,2003,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/ostatu-2003-gloria-tempranillo-rioja/,"Full and ready, this fabulous wine from Rioja Alavesa sets the bar very high for any of its Vanguardia co-runners. Gloria hits hard with bacon, tire rubber, tobacco and pastry crust aromas, but also pure dark fruit. Then it's wave after wave of boysenberry and crisped brown sugar flavors prior to a finale of heady European chocolate. Need we say more? 750 cases produced; best now through 2011."
245649,Tempranillo,Viñedos de Paganos 2004 El Puntido  (Rioja),Spain,57,96,2004,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/vinedos-paganos-2004-el-puntido-tempranillo-rioja/,"As expected, the wine exhibits a dense black color, with mineral, burnt toast and dark fruit on the bouquet. The flavor profile offers cured meat, leather, graphite and plenty of blackberry, mocha, caramel and coffee. Beautiful modern Rioja. 4,000 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc."
245739,Pinot Noir,Iron Horse 2005 Thomas Road Pinot Noir (Green Valley),US,70,95,2005,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/iron-horse-2005-thomas-road-pinot-noir-sonoma-green-valley/,"No doubt about it, this is a big, lusty Pinot Noir. From a low-production parcel of the estate, it routinely produces immensely concentrated wines. The winemaker's challenge is to give balance and harmony to grapes of this heft, and here, Iron Horse has it figured out. Dry and enormously ripe in cherries, black raspberries, cocoa and cola, it's good now with lamb chops, grilled steaks and similar upscale fare, and should soften and improve for five years."
245740,Tempranillo,Telmo Rodríguez 2004 Altos de Lanzaga  (Rioja),Spain,105,95,2004,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/telmo-rodriguez-2004-altos-de-lanzaga-tempranillo-rioja/,"Masculine and heady stuff, as leather, espresso, smoked meat, mocha and intense blackberry aromas set the stage for an intense, driven, structured palate that's full of coconut, vanilla bean, cocoa and pure plum and berry. A serious nuevo classico Rioja if there ever was one."
245741,Syrah,M. Chapoutier 2004 L'Ermite  (Hermitage),France,250,95,2004,Rhône Valley,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/m-chapoutier-2004-lermite-shiraz-syrah-syrah-hermitage/,"Wonderfully aromatic and complex, blending floral notes with mineral scents, bold cassis fruit and cracked pepper. This is full-bodied and muscular on the palate, the only one of Chapoutier's 2004s that really demands cellaring. Drink 2010–2020."
245742,Tempranillo,Artadi 2004 Pagos Viejos  (Rioja),Spain,95,95,2004,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/artadi-2004-pagos-viejos-tempranillo-rioja/,"Classic in color, and backed by aromatics of lavender, graphite and pure blackberry. This is not overly weighty, as the acidity keeps it pointed and pure. There's a lot of elegance and balance to this wine; a perfect example of how to blend multiple vineyards into one excellent whole."
245745,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria 2004 Finca El Bosque  (Rioja),Spain,145,95,2004,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/sierra-cantabria-2004-finca-el-bosque-tempranillo-rioja/,"What a superb combination of new oak, leather, mineral, mocha and berry fruit this wine delivers. It's a giant, with a ripped palate of upfront boysenberry and then coffee and vanilla in support. All the power, precision and other attributes of modern Rioja are on display. Best in a few more years."
245747,Tempranillo,Finca Allende 2004 Calvario  (Rioja),Spain,105,95,2004,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/finca-allende-2004-calvario-tempranillo-rioja/,"The bouquet explodes with tobacco, leather, dry oak and waves of berry fruit. In the mouth, the wine sits comfortably on the tongue, with firm tannins offering structure to the bedazzling boysenberry, black cherry and cassis flavors. Long and intoxicating on the finish. It's 90% Tempranillo and 10% Garnacha and Graciano. 650 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc."
245748,Syrah,M. Chapoutier 2004 Le Méal  (Hermitage),France,202,96,2004,Rhône Valley,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/m-chapoutier-2004-le-meal-shiraz-syrah-syrah-hermitage/,"Le Méal is said to be the warmest terroir on the Hermitage hill, and thus it is no surprise that this bottling fared the best in the challenging 2004 vintage. Flamboyant, creamy waves of raspberry fruit flood the palate, bringing hints of meat, smoke and pepper along for the ride and developing lovely soft tannins on the caressing finish. Approachable now, but should age well through 2020."

Espresso, black olive and floral notes zoom from the glass, backed by layers of rich, creamy cherry fruit, making this a complex, complete wine. Tannins are amazingly supple, imparting a velvety feel to the long finish. Drink now–2025 and beyond."

It's all wrapped in a blanket of soft tannins, but stays fresh-tasting thanks to great minerality despite low acidity. Drink now–2030 or beyond."
245754,Tempranillo,Viñedos de Paganos 2005 La Nieta  (Rioja),Spain,150,97,2005,Northern Spain,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/vinedos-paganos-2005-nieta-tempranillo-rioja/,"The best new release in the Eguren family's collection of modern Rioja wines is this small-production, 100% Tempranillo. It's a true nuevo classico with proper touches of smoked meat, herbs and sweet black fruits as well as a lush, round mouthfeel that culminates in a mile-long finish. Destined to rock your socks off. Just over 300 cases produced. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc."

It would be a wine to sit and smell all day if it weren't so delicious to taste. Rich waves of cassis fruit cascade over the palate without losing complexity, buffered by incredibly supple tannins. The virtually endless finish confirms the quality. Drink now–2030+."

It's darkly fruited and superripe, yet doesn't lose its essential sense of terroir, remaining marked by scents of pepper and espresso to go with the chocolate and cassis fruit. Velvety in texture, this is the one of Guigal's 2003 Côte-Rôties that demands a few years of cellaring. Drink 2010–2040."

The '05 is a blend of Silver Pines, Van der Kamp, Chris Lee and others, and it's gorgeous. Rewards for its high acid, silky feel, so light and airy, and for the intensity of cola, cherry, pomegranate, smoky vanilla cream and Asian spice flavors that last on the finish. Should pick up additional nuance for the next four years."

It's immediately enjoyable for the wealth of cherries, blackberries and raspberries, with a decadent edge of melted milk chocolate. Oak adds extra dimensions of smoky vanilla, caramel, butterscotch and gingerbread. Those who think they don't like red wine will enjoy. Hard to tell if it has the stuffing for the long haul, but it's gorgeous now and for the next six years."
246618,Red Blend,Vall Llach 2004 Red (Priorat),Spain,85,96,2004,Catalonia,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/vall-llach-2004-red-priorat/,". Stand up and take note: this is great wine from Priorat. And that's regardless of whether it is typically Priorato in style. It trades textbook minerality for lushness, and the fruit is star quality. In the mouth, there's an explosion of grape matter that leaves coffee, chocolate, peanut brittle and vanilla. Almost drinkable right now but best from 2009."

The vineyard is in one of the coolest parts of Carneros, where the maritime influence has given crisp acidity boosting long hangtime fruit. The cherry, raspberry and cola flavors are gorgeous, while the earthier pomegranates and rhubarb are elevated to pie-filling sweetness. Yet the wine is entirely dry. What a beauty."

The block is now being replanted. This is the Pinot that established Rochioli's reputation, and the bottling remains a superstar. The '05 is very dry, crisp and full-bodied, with a flood of cherry-pie filling, pomegranate, rhubarb, Beefsteak tomato and flashy new oak. It's young and immature in tannins, and needs cellaring. Best after 2009, it will gain complexity through 2015."

Typically, the wines start out almost heavy and dense, but age well. Dry, crisp and jammy now, it has a flood of cherry kirsch, raspberry purée, cola and new oak flavors that finish with great charm and complexity. The '05, from a cool vintage, should hold and improve through 2015."

But more than that, it exudes authority; a dense and solid wine with an impressive presence and texture. It has a velvet mouthfeel: the tannins are dusty and mineral, alongside fruit flavors of ripe black plums and dark figs, leavened with fresh acidity. The potential, of course, is there: 20 years if you can wait."
247845,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Margaux 2006 Barrel Sample  (Margaux),France,NULL,95,2006,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-margaux-2006-barrel-sample-red-margaux/,"94-96 Barrel Sample  A year in which Château Margaux had a much higher percentage (90%) than usual of Cabernet Sauvignon. The result is a wine that is pure fruit, very juicy, packed with black currants. It is surprisingly soft even for the usually elegant Margaux, a vintage that will develop relatively fast over 10 years."

But because it is Pétrus, those deliciously lively black fruits are backed up with a formidable battery of tannins and concentration. But never extracted, always properly restrained"
247858,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Latour 2006 Barrel Sample  (Pauillac),France,NULL,96,2006,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-latour-2006-barrel-sample-red-pauillac/,"95-97 Barrel Sample  A ripe wine, showing some concentration but less than in some years at Latour. The acidity. however, is evident, giving a structured , fresh but powerful wine. There is spice from the new wood, but this certainly does not dominate."
247859,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Lafite Rothschild 2006 Barrel Sample  (Pauillac),France,NULL,96,2006,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-lafite-rothschild-2006-barrel-sample-red-pauillac/,"95-97 Barrel Sample  The fruit here is so rich, so juicy that it seems almost ready to drink now—until the tannins kick in. They power down on those delicious fruits, giving them a burst of structure, new wood and spice."

The fruit is certainly ripe, but it is the big boned character of the wine that is the most impressive. There is a mineral layer to the flavor of the wine, a fascinating additional complexity."
247861,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Vieux Château Certan 2006 Barrel Sample  (Pomerol),France,NULL,96,2006,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/vieux-chateau-certan-2006-barrel-sample-red-pomerol/,"95-97 Barrel Sample  A ripe, perfumed wine with spice and sweet, delicious fruit, sustained by dense, opulent tannins and red fruits. A greater dominance of Merlot in the wine in 2006 has resulted in a richer, fatter wine than usual."

This is so true of 2004, with its hugely firm structure underlying the initial supple fruit. At the end, the acidity is an enticing surprise, lifting the aftertaste."
247863,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Latour 2004  Pauillac,France,NULL,97,2004,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-latour-2004-red-pauillac/,"There are tannins, structure and power, but also supreme elegance. The 2004 acidity comes through in the sweet cassis flavors, supported at the back by dry tannins. Currently, the wine is closed up, losing some of its fresh fruit, but this is a moment in its slow evolution towards a classic Latour."
247866,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Cheval Blanc 2006 Barrel Sample  (Saint-Émilion),France,NULL,97,2006,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-cheval-blanc-2006-barrel-sample-red-saint-emilion/,"96-98 Barrel Sample  Dark chocolate and mocha flavors, very dark and intense, this is a big, concentrated wine, flavored with bitter cherries and structured. Certainly a great Cheval Blanc."

Vintage 2004 has given beautifully ripe Merlot, perfectly poised, but also showing the dryness and power. It is hugely intense, structured, bringing in blackberry flavors, fresh acidity and complex wood, perfumed and rich, concentrated. The aging potential? At least 20 years."

A mixture of Atlas Peak, Howell Mountain, Mount Veeder and St. Helena bench grapes, it's a masterpiece of blending. Seductive now for its lush, soft and brilliant cherry, cassis and mocha flavors that are finished with the smoky vanilla and toast of 96% new French oak, the wine is decadently good."
247854,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Léoville Las Cases 2006 Barrel Sample  (Saint-Julien),France,NULL,95,2006,Bordeaux,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-leoville-las-cases-2006-barrel-sample-red-saint-julien/,"94-96 Barrel Sample  Exceptionally rich wine, packed with solid Cabernet fruits.

It is so deliciously fresh and floating, with great black currant and blueberry fruits, pointed up by spice, mint and a sense of elegance and poise. There's no doubt about its aging potential either: just feel that heart of firm tannins."
