Only 430 cases were produced. It's a tremendous Chardonnay, just huge in the white Burgundy mode: ripe tropical fruit, new oak, lees, unfined and unfiltered. Right now, it's a little gangly, like an adolescent who's growing too fast. But we know this wine knits together as it ages. Best 2007–2011."
18578,Chardonnay,La Crema 2003 Nine Barrels Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),US,55,95,2003,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/crema-2003-nine-barrels-chardonnay-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"Only 200 cases were produced of this extraordinary wine. It just explodes in unfolding waves of lime custard, pineapple tart, ripe white peach, crème brûlée and Asian spice-box flavors, and a minerality usually found in Chards from the far Sonoma Coast. With that metallic stoniness comes mouthwatering, citrusy acidity leading to a long, dry finish."
18580,Chardonnay,Dutton-Goldfield 2004 Dutton Ranch Rued Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),US,45,95,2004,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/dutton-goldfield-2004-ranch-rued-vineyard-chardonnay-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"Four things define this wine. Extraordinarily ripe fruit, high acidity, a terroir-driven minerality, and lots of new French oak. The flavors are of tropical fruits, the ripest white peaches and vanilla cream, baked into spicy pastry crust. The impression is of impossible richness, California Chardonnay at its most opulent, flamboyant limit."
18584,Chardonnay,Talbott 2002 Diamond T Estate Chardonnay (Monterey),US,65,96,2002,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/talbott-2002-diamond-t-estate-chardonnay-central-coast-monterey/,"This has typical Talbottian heft, a gigantic Chard enormously rich in oak and munificent in flavor. Light pressing has captured the quintessence of cool-climate Chardonnay, heavenly rich and powerful, a flood of pineapple tart, Key lime pie, crème brûlée, smoky meringue and vanilla cinnamon toast."

There is elegance, fruit and wood along with a hint of ripe plums and peaches. But always that minerality, that steely character, which promise long aging."

At first smell and taste, it doesn't show much—its spice and green-fruit aromas are not at all obvious. It's when you roll it around your mouth, that all the layers of flavor emerge. It is powerful, rounded, but with a fine line of minerality that holds the whole wine on a knife edge. The wood is beautifully judged, the fruit just beginning to develop secondary aromas. Hold for several years."

No wonder Montrachet is seen as the greatest grand cru—it has structure, concentration, delicious fruit and layers of complexity. It also needs to age. To drink this wine now would be more than a shame."

There is minerality and finesse from the chalk, which gives a structure. And at the same time the ripe fruit seems opulent, with vanilla and spice flavors adding something exotic. Age this wine for at least 5 years."
19480,Chardonnay,Bouchard Père &amp; Fils 2004 La Cabotte  (Chevalier-Montrachet),France,500,96,2004,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bouchard-pere-fils-2004-cabotte-chardonnay-chevalier-montrachet/,"This comes from high up in the Chevalier-Montrachet vineyard, from vines surrounding a small workers shed, the “cabotte.” It is the better of the two bottlings from this vineyard by Bouchard, although “better” here is like differentiating between two stars on top form. It has great poise, so although the richness is there, it is shot through with acidity and citric flavors that underline the huge, ripe fruit. Age for 10 years for best results."
19481,Chardonnay,Chateau St. Jean 2003 Reserve Chardonnay (Sonoma County),US,45,96,2003,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-st-jean-2003-reserve-chardonnay-sonoma-county/,"What a roll St. Jean has been on with Chardonnay. This wine was made from a majority of Robert Young and Belle Terre vineyard fruit, and is two-thirds new French oak. The combination is mind-blowing. The vineyards contribute concentrated spicy, tropical fruit flavors and perfect acid balance, while the oak provides elaborate seasoning. Absolutely delicious. One of the most satisfying Chards of the vintage."

It is all about opulence, but it's balanced with layers of ripe fruit and wood. At this stage in its long life, this wine from a fine white wine vintage is still dominated by fruit. The secondary flavors will start to show in 3–4 years time. A powerful wine that does not lose sight of a potential partnership with food."

Of course, you'll find the ripe tropical fruit and new oak and lees of other Chardonnays, but it's really that tanginess that attracts. Currently the wine shows primary flavors of mangoes and papayas, but it would not surprise me if it ages well beyond five years."

It shows fresh, sweet pineapple fruit and spicy overtones of cinnamon and nutmeg along with layers of minerals and dried herbs. Easily takes its place in the front ranks of California Chardonnay."

This grand cru, structured and still waiting to open to its full opulence, is packed with concentrated flavors. It's a powerhouse that needs at least five years to even begin to show its structure, ripe fruit and richness."
19888,Chardonnay,Domaine Leflaive 2003 Clavoillon Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),France,113,95,2003,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-leflaive-2003-clavoillon-premier-cru-chardonnay-puligny-montrachet/,"It's not so much the fruit but the richness and concentration that mark this wine. Yet it's not superripe because of the hot 2003 vintage. This wine, with its origins in biodynamically grown grapes, preserves a great purity of fruit as it layers intense almond and citrus flavors over vanilla and yellow fruit tastes. It should age well."
19891,Chardonnay,Louis Latour 2004  Criots-Bâtard-Montrachet,France,250,95,2004,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/louis-latour-2004-chardonnay-criots-batard-montrachet/,"This is the one grand cru that is entirely in Chassagne-Montrachet. It's a tiny patch of land (4.13 acres) making wines that are more delicate than the others. With its fine, fresh flavors so light to the taste, this is a wine that floats on the palate with a smooth, silky texture. Wood and white peaches contribute but do not dominate."

At this stage, it is still very tight and closed up, but there is so much leashed power there, along with complex hints of fruits, minerals and exotic perfumes. Give it at least five years, and it will begin to slowly evolve."

A  rich and viscous mouthfeel, yet miraculously crisp at the same time; the acids keep the finish echoing in your mouth for a long, long time."

The flavors are as intricate as a tapestry, weaving together black currants, blueberries, plums, cocoa, macaroons, spices and sweet oak. Thoroughly dry, this is great Laurel Glen. Decant now; drinkable through at least 2015."

There are similarities in the Baroque structure and complex, layered lemondrop flavors that new oak so flatters. There's a tight, minerally acidity; it's a little leesy-sour right now, and all the parts haven't come together, but for sheer dazzle, you can't beat it. Cellar until the end of 2006 and drink through 2008."

This wine is more so. It's drier, more acidic and more elegant, but there's nothing lean about the power of its core of tropical fruit, which detonates on the palate and doesn't stop. There's fascination with every sip, as the wine slowly changes in the glass. This is a great wine and showcases the infinite possibilities of this appellation."

36148,Riesling,Maximin Grünhäuser 2003 Abtsberg Beerenauslese Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer),Germany,167,95,2003,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/maximin-grunhauser-2003-abtsberg-beerenauslese-riesling-mosel-saar-ruwer/,"Heavily botrytized, this thick, unctuous wine virtually oozes with dried apricots and spiced applesauce aromas and flavors. So much going on it's hard to adequately describe, with a long, sticky finish."
36151,Chardonnay,Pine Ridge 2002 Le Petit Clos Chardonnay (Stags Leap District),US,50,95,2002,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/pine-ridge-2002-le-petit-clos-chardonnay-napa-stags-leap-district/,"Brutally good, a wine so powerful in ripe tropical fruits and new smoky oak that it just detonates the palate. Huge, mouth-filling flavors of mango and pineapple, caramelized oak, butterscotch, cinnamon, clove, vanilla, toast and who knows what else cascade in waves, ending in a super-long, sweet finish. Massive, but balanced and elegant. If it had a slightly denser middle, it would be perfect."
39450,Chardonnay,Louis Latour 2002  Corton-Charlemagne,France,100,96,2002,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/louis-latour-2002-chardonnay-corton-charlemagne/,"Immense power lies behind the initially seductive nature of this wine. It is powerful, ripe, complex, full of tropical fruits, and still at first it seems to be restraining this intensity. Give it 10 years and it will be mind-blowing."

And yet the wine, intensely sweet, isn't at all cloying. Amazing, but probably impossible to find: 8 cases made."
42916,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem 2001 Hawk Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),US,44,95,2001,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/williams-selyem-2001-hawk-hill-vineyard-chardonnay-sonoma-russian-river-valley/,"Stunning, a hugely aromatic wine bursting with lemondrop, lemon meringue pie and smoky oak aromas. It detonates in the mouth with sweet lemon custard, vanilla and pear flavors that are enormously rich, accompanied by bright acids that penetrate the nerve endings. Lasts for a long time on the finish."
49213,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem 2000 Hirsch Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),US,42,95,2000,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/williams-selyem-2000-hirsch-vineyard-chardonnay-sonoma-coast/,"Creamy smooth but balanced by firm, tangy acidity, and toasty oak and hazelnut flavors. This complex, elegant and sensual wine coats the palate with ripe melon, pear, fig and apple flavors, all highlighted by fresh lemon, orange and herb notes. Clean and long on the finish, this is top-notch Chardonnay. Editors' Choice. —J.M."

Burgundian in style, it features butterscotch, jasmine, honeysuckle and even some cream soda on the nose. The buttery, citrus flavors unfold little by little until you have what can best be described as a marvelous wine."

Smoky and intriguing fruit. Rich mouthfeel, beautiful texture and balance. Very flavorful, but more than that, it shows tremendous nuance and subtlety. Sensuous and profound."

In this sumptuous year, the wine is more generous, ripe yellow fruits than mineral texture. The acidity and the tangy aftertaste are a reminder that this is from cool-climate Chablis. Drink from 2023."

The flavors follow through along a lengthy layered pathway lined in sparks of anise and key lime, finishing in juicy crisp acidity."

It is the fruit, though, that sings in this beautiful wine. Mango and peach blend with the crispest citrus flavors. The wine demands aging and is still young. Drink from late 2018."

A whiff of smoke carries throughout, and its sheer complexity strains the vocabulary. Stay with it as more subtle layers unfold. Though seductive now, it should mature well through 2030."
64248,Chenin Blanc,Château de Parnay 2011 Clos d'Entre les Murs  (Saumur),France,120,95,2011,Loire Valley,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chateau-de-parnay-2011-clos-dentre-les-murs-saumur/,"This wine comes from a vineyard, created in 1894, in which the vines are planted against walls to get the maximum reflected heat. It is a majestic wine—a smooth wave, opulent and rich with intense acidity and just a hint of spice. The wine is just ready to drink, although it will be even more impressive from 2018."
64253,Riesling,Trisaetum 2016 Ribbon Ridge Estate Dry Riesling (Ribbon Ridge),US,32,96,2016,Oregon,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/trisaetum-2016-ribbon-ridge-estate-dry-riesling-ribbon-ridge/,"Stunningly good, this hits you with waves of fruit, acidity and spice. It reverberates across, down and through the palate, recalling clover, citrus zest and grapefruit, all underlaid by bracing minerality."
66558,Chardonnay,Ramey 2014 Ritchie Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),US,65,95,2014,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/ramey-2014-ritchie-vineyard-chardonnay-russian-river-valley/,"From blocks of old Wente vines planted in the 1970s, this producer and site continue to find beautiful synergy together. This wine shows high-toned floral notes around full-bodied richness and flavors of crème brûlée and anise. A salty accent begs for attention as a kick of citrus finishes with grace and freshness."
68089,Riesling,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Clos Windsbuhl Riesling (Alsace),France,80,95,2015,Alsace,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-zind-humbrecht-2015-clos-windsbuhl-riesling-alsace/,"Funky notions of yeast still cloud the nose. The palate gives us tense, concentrated lemon and tangerine zest at first but you feel that there is more strength, almost raw force, at the core of this that still needs to develop and work out its balance. This is a big wine, energetic and dry, intense and generous but not yet fully fledged. Drinking it now would rob it of its as of yet untapped essence. For now it is lemon purity that holds sway but there will be so much more. Cellar from 2022–2035, at least."
68105,Pinot Gris,Domaine Ostertag 2015 Fronholz Pinot Gris (Alsace),France,57,95,2015,Alsace,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-ostertag-2015-fronholz-pinot-gris-alsace/,"The nose suggests utter generosity of ripe juicy pear fruit. The palate enforces this with rounded, aromatic and very pure notes of ripe Bartlett pear. The flavors are precisely drawn, framed by incisive freshness that corsets the richness and gives it a beautiful outline. There is barely concealed strength here and great energy. You can feel the warmth of the sun that ripened these lovely grapes. The finish is lasting and dry. Drink 2017—2030."
68106,Riesling,Trimbach 2013 Réserve Riesling (Alsace),France,34,95,2013,Alsace,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/trimbach-2013-reserve-riesling-alsace/,"Pure citrus zest rises from the glass: lovely, ripe lemon and zesty lime. The palate reinforces these flavors in a rapier-like fashion, with drive and energy in a very linear energetic way. This seem like an elixir or a tonic full of vim, all informed by a central dynamic freshness. This has barely blossomed but promises much future pleasure. This genie should be contained in its bottle for a while longer before letting it loose. It's something to look forward to. Drink 2020–2035."
68110,Gewürztraminer,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Clos Windsbuhl Gewurztraminer (Alsace),France,80,95,2015,Alsace,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-zind-humbrecht-2015-clos-windsbuhl-gewurztraminer-alsace/,"A clean-cut top note of citrus hovers above the otherwise still-closed nose. The palate comes in with a concentrated richness that is as much sustained by residual sweetness as it is by sheer force of fruit: candied lemon and orange, juicy pear, ripe mirabelle and yellow peach. There also is a zesty spicy pithiness on the midpalate that frames and guides the wine alongside invigorating lemon freshness that lets this finish off dry despite the richness. This is yet to unfold fully. Lovely now, sure to improve. Drink 2020—2035."
68111,Riesling,Robert Weil 2015 Kiedrich Gräfenberg Auslese Riesling (Rheingau),Germany,182,95,2015,Rheingau,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/robert-weil-2015-kiedrich-grafenberg-auslese-riesling-rheingau/,"Rich layers of honey and nectar roil through this lip-smackingly tropical wine. It's penetrating and juicy, flush with sweet mango, guava and citrus flavors. Cutting lime acidity and mineral intensity jolt the midpalate through an endlessly lingering finish. Stunning already it should improve for decades to come."
68112,Chardonnay,Joseph Phelps 2015 Freestone Vineyards Estate Grown Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),US,55,95,2015,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/joseph-phelps-2015-freestone-vineyards-estate-grown-chardonnay-sonoma-coast/,"Voluptuously succulent and welcoming, this coastal wine seduces with its caramel apple, pear and preserved lemon flavors, edged with high-toned acidity and an exotic touch of seaspray. That sense of the sea plays out on the palate in texture, too, with a stony note that lingers in nutty spice."
68113,Riesling,Dr. Loosen 2015 Erdener Prälat Gold Capsule Auslese Riesling (Mosel),Germany,114,95,2015,Mosel,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/dr-loosen-2015-erdener-pralat-gold-capsule-auslese-riesling-mosel/,"It's hard to find a favorite within Dr. Loosen's excellent line up of 2015 auslese, but this bottling stands out for its kaleidoscope of fruit, floral and earthen complexities. Sumptuous and ripe, fleshy white peach and grapefruit flavors undulate on the palate. It's finely framed, edged by sharp lines of slate, spine-tingling acidity and swathes of fennel and earth. The finish feels fragile, laced in sweetness and lingering."
68114,Riesling,Egon Müller 2015 Scharzhofberger Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),Germany,175,95,2015,Mosel,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/egon-muller-2015-scharzhofberger-spatlese-riesling-mosel/,"Racy and deeply mineral, yet buoyantly fruity, this wine embodies the best from the Mosel's fantastic 2015 vintage. It's lavishly forward in ripe yellow peach, apricot and honeydew flavors, yet bracingly high in acidity. Satisfyingly rich in extract yet feather light, it finishes long, with shards of slate and crushed mineral. Stunning already, it should continue to improve through 2030, likely beyond."
68115,Riesling,Domaine Ostertag 2015 Heissenberg Riesling (Alsace),France,48,95,2015,Alsace,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-ostertag-2015-heissenberg-riesling-alsace/,"A heady swirl of Amalfi lemon hits you right in the heart, if not the nose. The lemon notes become even more fully expressed on the taut but full, streamlined but expressive and dry body: they take the rich guise of lemon oil and candied peel. They are utterly tart and fresh but with that golden ripeness at their very core that makes this rather seductive. Taste buds just want to get to the bottom of this and rejoice in the purity and fruity tang. This is translucent and refreshing but also rich and full of delicious lemony vigor. The finish is lip-smacking. It will be hard to resist this, but this is certain to get even better. Drink now through 2035."
68117,Riesling,Domaine Ostertag 2015 Fronholz Riesling (Alsace),France,48,96,2015,Alsace,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-ostertag-2015-fronholz-riesling-alsace/,"Peach and tangerine unite to create an utterly seductive nose: luscious juicy flesh is defined by aromatic spice and zestiness. These opposites play off each other and create something that is alive and vigorous, joyful and precious. There is concentration and poise, structure and texture, but none of this concerns the hedonistic forces at play. They just want to express their careless exuberance. There is something defiant about this dry concentrated wine. Perhaps it is a welcome and encouraging counterweight to so much sadness in the world."

Its unique palate blends bright lemon-lime, Asian pear and Marcona almond flavors with a crushed shell minerality that brings the seashore to mind."
69974,Chardonnay,Center of Effort 2014 Giallo Solare Chardonnay (Edna Valley),US,60,95,2014,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/center-of-effort-2014-giallo-solare-chardonnay-edna-valley/,"The apogee of this ambitious winery's white wine efforts, this bottling of just two barrels of Clone 5 shows focused marzipan, marcona almond and white peach notes on the nose. The palate sizzles with saltiness and a lemony acidity that cuts through its brown butter richness with finesse. The finish is luxurious and long."

It's got a rich core of butterscotch and the seemingly endless layers of subtle flavors that biodynamic farming can bring. It spends 18 months on the lees prior to bottling. Drink now through 2028."

Its pristine pineapple and yellow cherry flavors collapse like silk on the palate, electrified with acidity and a heady floral flair. Its fruit expression is pure and transparent, lingering endlessly on the finish. Beautiful already but should improve through 2040."

Medium-bodied, it unravels slowly in the glass, continuing to pursue different avenues of flavor and intellectual pleasure."

It's lusciously sweet but not cloying, with spine-tingling acidity and pleasantly musky saffron notes that intensify on its long, lean finish. Delicious already, it will continue to improve through 2040."

This nutty toasty chiseled wine has impeccable breeding, power and elegance. White peach, pear and apple fruit is wrapped in lush barrel flavors of caramel, buttered toast and vanilla wafer, with firm acids for a foundation. Drink now and on through 2025."

The wine—the flagship of the cooperative—is opulent, showing strong wood aging flavors that will soften with time. Ripe and generous with yellow fruit flavor, it also boasts a tight mineral acidity and crispness, making it a good candidate for cellaring. Drink from 2021."

The palate comes in with lovely generous sweetness that amplifies that chamomile-tisane notion and boosts the dried-fruit notes. Against the distinctly medium-sweet fruitiness stands a clarion line of acidity. The evolution of fruit flavors weaves a colorful tapestry of aromas. This is carefully balanced and quietly intense. It holds immense strength at its core that radiates flavor and fruit. Made from a field blend of Alsace varieties, each adds something: aroma, texture, freshness and body. The finish is endless and very fruity. Have this with cheese or a subtle dessert. Drink now through 2035."

The aromas are reminiscent of evolving Riesling but this is not the only grape in this expressive and highly aromatic field blend. While there is distinct residual sweetness on the palate, this has a counterweight in the rich texture of the midpalate. There is something authentic and deeply comforting and satisfying at the core of this wine that says Alsace. It's impossible to put this wine into a box, it needs to be tasted and enjoyed on its very own terms. The finish is medium sweet, totally soil-driven and very, very long. This is an experience rather than a drink. Drink now through 2035."

Underneath that is lemony purity. The palate adds a touch of stone fruit, a touch of ripe mirabelle plum—its generosity only underlined by the taut lemon freshness that pervades the wine. There is something stern and stony at the core, something fundamental and profound. The body is precise, dry and powerful and incredibly moreish. This is lip smacking but has not even started to show itself properly. The finish is clean, stony and lasting. This is one to keep. Drink 2020–2040."

A hint of mossy earth, chamomile tisane, Cox Orange Pippin apples or lemon zest? All of these aromas dance on the nose. They are still totally shy on the taut, dry and concentrated palate. For now, it is mossy citrus that is most aromatic while rich fruit still needs to unfurl. This strikes a note of utter purity, of something soaring and bright. Right now this is totally brisk, invigorating and refreshing but its true colors won't show for some time. Drink 2020–2035."

The palate cuts in with uncompromising purity and zestiness—this really wants to showcase pure stone and tart citrus. There are glimpses, however, of plump ripe mirabelle plums and a touch of dried pear and quince. Nonetheless, this is governed by stern tanginess and thus is for real adults only.

The palate adds immense and appetizing spice to the pear notions, edging it with pepper and yeasty notes of soy and sandalwood. The palate is ripe and concentrated but deeply textured and made precise by zesty grapefruit freshness. It appears compact and precise and has a lasting, impressive impact, shining with pure fruit and aromatics. Lovely now but certain to improve with some bottle age. Drink 2017–2035."

The palate is a clearly delineated but gorgeous canvas for foliage-fringed citrus—mandarin, clementine and tangerine all vie for space while yuzu adds spice and savor. There is generosity and slenderness. The finish is ultra clean and the entire wine is surprisingly approachable.

Once this is ready, it will unfurl into glorious lemon zest and oil notions. For now, this is taut and tight, secretive and closed.

The palate confirms all of this rich freshness, which streams with great direction across the palate. This is taut and concentrated, with a poised freshness and structure that holds very rich lemon and tangy citrus at its core. There is so much drive and direction.

The palate is edged with very precise zesty grapefruit hints that frame and corset a most generously white-pepper-spiced host of pear and yellow plum fruit.

The palate rides that chalky line the whole way, offering hints of lime pith, tangerine, sea salt and just enough almond warmth."

The palate is concentrated, streamlined and presents a panoply of zesty citrus notes: mandarin and lemon peel one moment, lime and grapefruit the next. Totally charming in its youth, this really is made for the long run. Drink 2016–2030 at least."
88847,Chardonnay,Patz &amp; Hall 2014 Hudson Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),US,55,95,2014,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/patz-hall-2014-hudson-vineyard-chardonnay-carneros/,"This is the kind of wine that might leave you speechless, it's so good, so complex and so well made. The tenth vintage from this marquee vineyard site, it shows dark-golden color and pungent toasted-oak aromas, with a touch of petrol. Smooth and nearly full bodied, it celebrates all notions of pear, apple and almond atop lifted acidity and a lengthy finish."

The core of this delicately honeyed wine is still vibrantly fruity, concentrated in luscious yellow peach and cherry flavors. Intonations of maturity show in glimpses of creamy cashew, dried mushroom and crushed rock that extend from nose to finish. It should maintain its spry, electric feel from now through 2021 at least."
90344,Chardonnay,Chanin 2014 Bien Nacido VIneyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),US,40,95,2014,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/chanin-2014-bien-nacido-vineyard-chardonnay-santa-maria-valley/,"Gavin Chanin's wines manage to pack a stunning array of elements behind a veil of restraint, here showing sea salt, lemon skins, struck flint and smoked nectarine on the nose. The palate is alkaline and botanical in presentation, offering lime skin, chalk, dried butter flakes, cement and a salty acidity. The wine tastes like foggy sunshine."
90352,Chardonnay,Domaine Faiveley 2014  Corton-Charlemagne,France,333,95,2014,Burgundy,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-faiveley-2014-corton-charlemagne/,"Powerful and rich, this has a great spice component that shoots through the pure fruit flavors. It is already a delicious wine with its juicy acidity and fresh, zesty, mineral character. But at the same time, it has a great structure, beautifully ripe fruitiness and excellent potential. It will drink at its best from 2022."

Potent and rich, it's packed with layer upon layer of citrus and stone fruits. There's a seam of licorice, and concentrated flavors of almond and buttercream. This utterly decadent effort just goes and goes."

Yellow fruits are laced with a more finessed texture that adds minerality. It is a dense wine, full of fruit, with a measured touch of wood. Age this until 2021."

Layers of new wood (100%) are blended with rich and perfumed fruits. At the same time, the acidity goes right through the wine, indicating an impressive future. It comes from a tiny patch of vines that gave two barrels. Drink from 2022."

The only white from a sea of Pinot Noir grown here, it speaks to what the extreme Sonoma Coast can bring to the variety—a celebration of lemon zest, crisp apple and brioche, delicately wrapped in minerality."

On the elegantly structured palate, a mineral vein underscores crisp apple, pear, lemon zest and white almond. Vibrant acidity provides the backbone. It's still young so give it time to develop to its full potential. Drink 2018 through 2028."

The result is a rich but balanced wine, loaded with honey and toasted coconut but also boasting mouthwatering pineapple flavors and a tremendously long finish. Drink now–2025."

Ripe with touches of yellow fruits as well as lime and other citrus flavors, it is structured, dense and likely to age well. Drink from 2018."

Like many wines from this vineyard, this wine has immense power and concentration. It is rich, dense and full of tight but rich yellow and green fruits shot through with intense acidity. It is still very young and needs to be aged. Drink from 2019."

The vines are a selection from the family's Les Romains vineyard. It cannot be labeled Sancerre because of the experimental methods used in its production. The wine is young, needing to age to develop its concentrated fruits and rich apple and apricot flavors. Tight and tense at this stage, it will develop slowly. Drink this rare wine from 2019."

All the flavors are subdued and delicate with flinty smoke making an appearance here and there. All of this suggests that this is far too young to be approached: the structure, however, suggests delicacy and balance, tender flavors of linearity and precision. Smoke and salt characterize the long finish. Drink 2019–2035."

The palate is still in thrall to all the primary citrus notes but holds promise of stone and riper fruit. This is taut, elegant, concentrated, dry and whistle-clean. Like a superlative sports car waiting to be sped around a race track. This spells raciness, subtle power and linearity. What a super-clean finish. Drink 2020–2035."

Dry but pentratingly fruity, it contrasts ripe peach and grapefruit flavors against laser-sharp edges of acidity and minerality. Drinks beautifully now but should continue to please well into the next decade."

These aromas dance and take turns on the dry, balanced palate that shines both with rich fruit and slender tone. Lemony freshness pervades everything with its brightness. This is lovely now but will be even lovelier over the years. Drink 2016–2030."

It offers intense fruit concentration and retains the opulence for which the winery is known. Rich in a buttered, toasted nut flavor, the mouthfeel is creamy and sensual. The finish lingers for several minutes, and the wine drinks as well or better on the second day it's been open."

The palate is dry, restrained and sylph-like but with time reveals tangerine and lemon zest. This is a feast, a celebration of citrus flavors, unfolding and shimmering at every moment. This is dry but faceted, taut but playful. Irresistible now but with a brilliant, aromatic and totally seductive future ahead. Drink 2016–2030."

Struck flint and slate offer dark counterpoints to a lush, creamy palate full of ripe tangerine and apple marmalade flavors. It's a penetrating, deftly balanced wine that's both stimulating and thought-provoking. Drink now through 2021."
96898,Riesling,René Muré 2014 Clos Saint Landelin Vorbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),France,50,95,2014,Alsace,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/rene-mure-2014-clos-saint-landelin-vorbourg-grand-cru-riesling-alsace/,"The purity of juicy, tart, red apples runs like a fault line through a very taut, linear, whistle-clean Riesling. This has purity and precision, linearity and drive. Still tightly wound, this needs time to unfold but promises to be a wine of great longevity and expression. Resolutely dry, the purity and concentration of flavors will always remain. Drink 2018–2030."
96916,Muscat,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Goldert Grand Cru Muscat (Alsace),France,65,96,2013,Alsace,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-zind-humbrecht-2013-goldert-grand-cru-muscat-alsace/,"The pure, delicate but ever so authentic scent of fragrant Muscat grapes rises from the glass. The palate is a joy: a feather-light, fragrant but intense experience of pure Muscat flavor. There is the textural tinge of lemon freshness and the uncompromising notion of stone on a dry, sprightly and utterly disarming palate of immense purity. What we are left with is a notion of fragrance and stone."
96922,Riesling,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Clos Saint Urbain Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),France,120,96,2013,Alsace,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-zind-humbrecht-2013-clos-saint-urbain-rangen-de-thann-grand-cru-riesling-alsace/,"Subtle smoke hovers above earthy notes and the nose only holds the faintest suggestion of citrus. The palate comes forth with a vivid, leafy purity that suggests herbs, freshly turned earth and pure, lifted citrus. All we get right now are the flavors hovering above the core which is still firmly closed. A wealth of apple and citrus fruit is evoked which will awake with time, this is too young to be opened. Don't touch before 2018 and then drink until 2030 or even beyond. This is dry, delicate and yet powerful with a supremely clean finish."
96912,Riesling,Domaine Weinbach 2014 Schlossberg Grand Cru Cuvée Saint Catherine Riesling (Alsace),France,62,96,2014,Alsace,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-weinbach-2014-schlossberg-grand-cru-cuvee-saint-catherine-riesling-alsace/,"Faint notes of ripe pear are only hinted at on the nose but on the dry palate they open up into pure, textured, precisely drawn fruit. There is concentration and a heady, seductive lemon and pear perfume hovering over the concentrated, profound palate of wet stone and immensely pure lemon oil. This comes on light, delicate feet but leaves you with a deep, lasting and impressive memory of Riesling purity and elegance."

Barrel Sample. This is a magnificent wine with its tight acidity and beautiful citric character. The ripeness of the Sauvignon Blanc is remarkable while, for now, the texture of the wine is all minerality."

A whiff of pine needle continues as a flavor thread, along with vanilla, buttered nuts, lemongrass and macaroon. This wine just keeps on going."
97261,Gewürztraminer,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Clos Saint Urbain Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),France,120,95,2013,Alsace,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-zind-humbrecht-2013-clos-saint-urbain-rangen-de-thann-grand-cru-gewurztraminer-alsace/,"The subtle, rounded but rather aromatic perfume of peach skins and apricot compote on the nose is utterly seductive—there is a promise of oriental riches and exotic spice but above all pure, glowing peach fruit. The palate is in total focus: while some residual sugar illuminates every last vestige of fruit, there is guiding central force that never lets this slip into the merely opulent. A masterful tightrope walk amidst plump fruit and mineral precision with a finishing, pleasantly bitter edge of marzipan."
97288,White Blend,Carlisle 2013 The Derivative White (Sonoma County),US,28,95,2013,California,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/carlisle-2013-the-derivative-white-sonoma-county/,"This marks another stunning vintage for this blend of 55% Sémillon, 25% Muscadelle, 10% Palomino and 10% Colombard, made by Zin master Mike Officer. Pungent in pear and pineapple, it has cutting-edge minerality, a taste of slate, and remains at turns creamy and crisp on the palate. This wine is unusual in all the right ways yet triumphantly delicious."

The aromatic impression leads onto a slender, dry and fluid palate that still seems tightly coiled and closed. But those subtle aromatic hints and a concentrated, stony palate promise future pleasure. This will blossom into a perfumed marvel. Drink 2019–2030."

The body is lithe and light, with a backdrop of stone and subtle nuttiness. With a little more air, the characteristic notes of mature Riesling appear: some lifted chamomile and candied orange peel, but only in their early stages. This is a wine of immense depth and deceptive lightness that has years of life ahead. Drink through 2030."

The palate subsumes these in a tight, taut, savory core of immense energy and power. There is muscle and tone, power and punch. If you are looking for a superlatively spicy, long-lived Grüner, this is the one to get. Underneath you will find notions of stone and earth that anchor this firmly. The finish is clean and long. Drink 2017–2020."

As befits this vintage, everything is tempered with grapefruit zestiness but both mirabelle and apricot richness not only lend flavor but also a beautiful texture that insinuates quince and blood orange zest. What a triumph, what a marvel. Irresistible now but with incredible concentration this is built to last. Drink now till 2020 at least."

The zestiness glistens on the surface, the tightly closed, still earthy fruit broods at the core. Wait for it to explode. Drink 2018–2028."

The intensity of spicy grapefruit and the skin of still-green Seville oranges transports you to utopian shores. That such flavor should come from grapes is one of nature's unresolved, eternal mysteries. That this should shine in such a concentrated, slender wine is a marvel."

The concentration of flavor is immense and has the verve, drive and linearity of a jet-engine on on takeoff. The palate slows down the motion and captures the nuanced flavors of Seville orange—tinged green, bitter, juicy and tart at the same time. This will not reach its finish line for years but will provide racy enjoyment all the way. Drink 2018–2030."

It's tight while bursting with fruit. The structure is complex, dense and very mineral in character. It is a wine that will need many years, so drink from 2022. The production is tiny, and what is not fit for this wine goes into the Dillon Clarté wine."

Citrus also continues to be the focus on the palate: fresh zest of ripe lemons and Meyer lemons just edged by peppery spice. This is taut and very linear, streamlined, concentrated and slender but still tightly wound. This will relax into more spice and fruit with a little while in bottle. Right now it is a zesty, evocative mouthful of promise."

As a drinker you just want to dive into this inviting, fragrant pool of refreshment. There is a powdery edge too, and quite some texture, despite the most slender of bodies. This represents depth rather than power and is a ticket straight to a citrussy Riesling heaven. With age this will get even better."

The alluring juiciness of the palate hints at small, yellow mirabelle plums but as of yet merely plays at the surface. Underneath it all is a solid powerhouse bursting with Seville orange, freshness and precision. Another one to keep, guard and treasure for a precious but enlightening soirée. The endless length reinforces that promise. Drink 2018–2025."

The citrus notions are promises of tart grapefruit, tangy orange, ripe tangerine and the purest lemon. There is something definite and astute that stands with an absolutely straight backbone, just waiting for its time to arrive. It will be spectacular. Drink from 2019."

This is suave and slender, with a very light but deceptive touch: apple and stone fruit, now wound tightly in citrus lie in wait, ready to burst forth when their moment comes. As floating as a breeze, as lasting as a stone. Drink 2017–2023."

The palate bristles with wonderfully tingling citrus freshness that highlights all the aromatic aspects in turn: the fruitiness, the ripeness, the savory backdrop of yeast and the light-footed but concentrated core. This is still very young but so ready and utterly irresistible, yet with the mileage to age. Don't drink too quickly—you'll miss the chance of savoring the peppery aftertaste."

The palate then invokes all the varietal spice: white pepper, arugula and chervil, illuminated by bright, zesty citrus to finish in a concert of layered zestiness. Overtones of orange and pink grapefruit zest make it even more compelling. Lip-smackingly irresistible and a paradigm of its vintage."

The palate unfolds in a still tightly contained bundle of lemon zest and juiciness. There is an undertow of riper texture, reminiscent of bitter orange zest and just as full of aromatic promise. This is wiry and slender but will mellow into seductive freshness and slick, almost cheeky tartness. With this concentration, it has all the makings of a flavor bomb and is something to really look forward to. Drink 2018–2030."

There is a hint of crunchy, crisp green apple combined with far richer notions of lemon zest and mandarin peel. Deeper down resides an earthy, yeasty core and a salty, stoniness.

The palate is more expressive, with sprightly lemon, aloe vera and the soothing notion of ripe green and yellow pears. There are pleasing shadows of pepper and herbal spice, but what is most convincing is the compact, complete fluidity with which this envelopes the palate. Another masterpiece that is so very true to its vintage from Birgit's talented hands."

Yellow peach and grapefruit tones shine brightly still, but are glazed by layers of slick, penetrating minerals. While moderate in alcohol, it feels dense and creamy on the palate. The finish meanders almost endlessly, punctuated playfully by strikes of lemon-lime acidity. It's singing now, but should improve till at least 2020."

However in cooler years, when the alcohol falls below 14%, it has something extra when details of skin and flower emerge as well.

Their richness is countered by grapefruit peel that gives verve and nerve to the entire wine, corsetting its ripeness with delicious citric acidity. There is a phenolic dimension, too, but that fizzling citrus freshness is just so much fun. This will stay fresh and exciting for a long time. Drink from 2016."

Underneath that, tightly curled freshness suggests both candied lemon slices and lemon sorbet—but this needs time to unfurl its glory. Despite its slenderness, this wine has muscle and tone, structure and poise. The long finish is lip-smacking and moreish. Drink 2018–2025."

Underneath that is grapefruit zest and pith and a herbal, stony, earthy edge. The palate is rich and curvaceous but completely toned by a pervasive, lemony acidity that lends drive and linearity. This is already approachable, which is not to say that it doesn't promise a lot of mileage: this will go on and unfold its facets of fruit. Immense charm almost plays over the fact that this is a very age-worthy wine, with a finish that's almost endless. Drink from 2017."

The streamlined palate reveals something that is equally generous and tart, like pink grapefruit or pomelo. There is a lovely phenolic texture, too, with intimations of riper fruit in the background that will still take their time to appear. Best to let this slumber for a while in a cool cellar. Drink as of 2018."

The citrus party continues on the palate, with zesty notes of citrus peel. Verve and freshness are kept only in slight check by a phenolic backbone and are driven on by the linear lemon freshness.

It is so powerfully evocative in crisply rendered Meyer lemon and tangerine notes, with aromas of fresh white flowers teasing provocatively on the nose. Seamless and seductively bright in acidity, it glides down the palate, hinting at a richness that never becomes overdone."

A yeasty edge pulls them down to earth, but their exuberance is evident, swirling and barely contained. This is lively, refreshing and totally invigorating. A celebration of ripe citrus draws a dynamic and dizzying fault line across the palate. Currently, minerality lurks in the background while the fruit dances. This will change intriguingly with time."

Displaying a deep straw, slightly tawny hue, it opens with lightly spicy, nuanced threads of mint, hay, olive oil, green banana and almond. It seems almost ephemeral, but with some hours of breathing time it opens into a full-bodied, dense and compelling wine, with the extra dimensions that old vines can provide. Drink now through 2030."

From one of the top Grand Cru vineyards in southern Alsace, it has richness while still preserving a light touch that brings out acidity and tight fruitiness. To contrast, the mineral texture adds a tense factor, very crisp and allowing the wine to age further. Drink until 2025."

It makes up in its rich structure, weight and tropical fruit flavors that are sliced by acidity. There is some kerosene along with these exotic fruits, and the wine does need to age.

Tasted over many hours, this stunning effort proved itself over and over. A mix of citrus oils, tree fruits, a hint of honey, tea, lemon verbena and more, it delivers astonishing complexity and flavor for such a young wine.

The wine is absolutely dry, mouthwatering in acidity, and vastly complex. There's a touch of smoky, vanilla-scented French oak, but the fruit flavors star. They suggest stone-driven minerals, Meyer lemons, limes, white peaches, pink grapefruits and a savory, umami-rich note of figs. The wine is ideal now and should evolve for many years."

The wine will blossom as of 2017."

It is a wonderful, ethereal paean to Riesling—crisp while intensely perfumed with aromas of fennel and licorice. It's dry in style, with elegant citrus flavors and a straight line of steely acidity, but finishes with a hint of honey. While delicious now, it's not quite mature and could continue to improve until 2025."

Whatever it is, or wherever it comes from, it's here big time, adding a lick of steel and a metallic mouthfeel to the underlying fruit. And what powerful fruit it is, ranging from orange and guava to honeydew and citron. This bone dry, crisp Chardonnay is a game changer that will make you look at California Chardonnay differently."

But it is one of their best ever. In fact, it's so classic, you could use it in a winemaking class to teach future vintners about how great Napa Sauvignon Blanc should taste. It's bone dry, brilliantly crisp with acidity and gently touched by oak. The main notes are of lees, which give a sourdough tang, and layers of lemons, limes, pink grapefruits, gooseberries and rich tropical fruits. An unbelievable value at this price, but only 1,975 cases were produced."

But meticulous farming resolves that issue, as evidenced by many years of River Block Pinot Noirs, including those from Williams Selyem. Now  Rochioli makes Chardonnay from the block, and what a fine wine it is. Dry, crisp and minerally, it has a Chablis-like stoniness, yet is rich in apples, pears and sweet oak. Great now, and will develop bottle complexity over the next 4–6 years."

It's notable for the tight, nervous feeling that acidity and minerals combine to stimulate, and the finish is very dry.

A silken texture on the midpalate is accented by hits of lime and crushed minerals. Its fruity, forward flavors are stunning already, but there's too much complexity here that's yet to develop. Hold till at least 2021 and it will continue to reward for years to come."

It was fermented in a thousand-liter Austrian cask, with a small percentage of botrytized fruit. It's almost liquorous, with botanical elements that accents its lime, candied citrus and dried papaya flavors. It's potent and packed with flavor yet impeccably balanced."

Despite the almost decadent flavors, it maintains its precision through a stunningly long finish and gets even better with aeration. Drink now through 2028."

The lively nose shows lemon-lime soda, honeydew, gardenia and sea shells, while the palate is framed by a stunning chalky tension and sizzling acidity. Flavors of honeysuckle and green melon meet with salty ocean spray toward the finish."

The wood aging has been well judged to give some spice and ginger flavors that will become more integrated over the next few months. Then the wine will develop slowly and majestically, probably being ready to drink from 2023."

Dazzling acidity pierces through a long, lingering finish and foretells a long, illustrious transformation for this wine as it melds and deepens in complexity."

Honeysuckle, lemon peel and flint tease and please around a focused core of oak and gritty texture of stone. Full bodied, it's lush and slightly reduced—a compelling statement on power and grace."

Aromas of honeydew rinds, Meyer lemon pith and honeysuckle meet with briny chalk, chiseled marble and a touch of almond warmth on the nose. The extremely fresh, clean and chalky palate shows stunning texture as well as rounded lemon blossom, sea salt and the faintest butter flavor."

The palate adds lovely vivid notes of zesty tangerine to this. Aromas of hay flowers also appear on this shimmering, aromatic, tight, taut and linear Riesling. Concentration fills the mouth with wonderfully light but sure-footed brightness and flavor. The dry long finish has a grounding earthy touch. Simply wonderful. Drink 2017–2035."

The streamlined palate comes in with bundled citrus notes. The tart flesh of tangerine and the zest of lemon are softened and enriched with orange oil and ample concentration. This is pure and racy, linear and bold. There is something salty and energetic, something incredibly fresh and vibrant at the core. The palate and finish are absolutely dry, the echo is long and clean. Blastingly fresh right now, sure to evolve. Drink 2019–2037."

There also is the merest hint of vanilla. The palate reprises these notes with creamy vanilla, ripe peach and honeysuckle. Warmth is palpable on this rather luscious, incredibly generous and still-evolving wine. The finish is beautifully corralled into zesty sweetness by ripe lemon. This is layered and complex and must be savored slowly. It will continue to develop. Drink 2017–2027."

The palate adds a judicious bitterness and counters this with residual sweetness. The counterpoint here is between texture and full fruit. This is incredibly powerful, as if some inner force was at work. This seems like a genie in a bottle—willful, driven and deliciously aromatic. The finish is off dry and long. Lovely now but sure to last. Drink 2017–2040."

On the exquisitely dry palate, it is the vivid, bright and intense lemon freshness that takes over, but those earthier notes still flash up around the edges, adding interest and depth. They will unfurl more as time passes. While this is linear, incisive and precise now, it will truly shine with bottle age. Drink 2017–2037."

A heady chamomile lift hints at some evolution. The absolutely dry palate is still vividly fresh and has barely begun to unfurl its store of rich aromas. For now the luminous freshness and brightness of pure ripe lemon zest still dominates. Here and there a touch of candle wax, stone and chamomile appears. From the 2011, this has barely begun its journey. A lovely, incisive, intense but elegant wine with a clean refreshing finish. Drink 2017–2030."

The palate is concentrated and full but appears much lighter—a combination of fresh acidity and an alluring touch of residual sweetness do their best to add a spring to the step of this unusual but captivating wine. Scintillating hints of mandarin peel, honeysuckle and kumquat make this incredibly moreish. The finish is off dry to medium sweet. Lovely now, but it's sure to last. Try with cheeses or spicy Asian dishes. Drink 2017–2027."

The palate unites all of these aromatic notions on a textured, layered and concentrated palate. The hints of honeysuckle spice are intensified by the ripe zestiness of Amalfi lemon and tangerine. The finish is dry and long, with ample refreshment from these gorgeous citrus notes. This is glorious now in its youthful exuberance but has the concentration, structure and fruit to age beautifully. Drink 2017–2035."

The palate adds a sonorous and pleasant bitterness to this, reminiscent of fir honey, while the floral overtones of honeysuckle shimmer everywhere. There is quite some warmth and energy in this wine, smouldering at the very core. This is lovely now but is sure to last with all its brooding power. The finish is long and dry and returns to that pure note of Williams pear. Drink 2017–2035."

On its fringes, delicious hints of chamomile and chervil appear alongside ripe red apple. This is a tantalizing charmer in spite of its absolute dryness and vivid acidity. Drink 2017–2037."

The leafiness of fragrant citrus foliage adds extra charm. All these notions continue to play on the very zesty, thoroughly aromatic palate. Citrus flesh and peel shimmers and swirls across mind and palate, creating a dreamy, heightened cloud of fragrant freshness. The palate is just off dry and lip-smackingly bright and fresh. A triumphantly long finish adds the allure of blood orange to this seductive, aromatic wine and makes it utterly irresistible. Drink 2017–2037."

The absolutely straightlaced, concentrated and dry palate adds hints of quince and blood orange. This is dry, even lean but absolutely powerful with bundled flavor. You can feel heat and energy at the core of this, there is real ripeness and force here, played against absolute, vivid and cleansing freshness. High drama indeed. Let it age a while before playing it out. It will be worth the wait. Drink 2022–2037."

But this is only a sign of youth, as is the residual carbon dioxide on the palate. While very young, this holds all it needs for a promising future: A bright core of juicy fruit—think tangerine, tart red apple and ripe yellow pear—as well as the vividly clean and racy freshness of bright lemon. This is concentrated and rather powerful, rapier-like in its cleansing, dry finish but also generous on its fruity midpalate. This is confident and self-assured and stands tall with its powerful structure and body. Leave this to calm down and become itself. Drink 2018–2037."

On the absolutely dry palate, however, a beautifully lithe, serene but all-encompassing cloud of lemon freshness just steals the show. It pervades and informs nose, palate and mind. Its luminosity and vivacious freshness just soars and sings. Yes, this is uncompromising. You have to like freshness, acidity and unflinching honesty to be a fan of this, but if you are, this is a ticket to vinous heaven. Wow. This is a real experience and a celebration of site and variety. Hoard this if you can. Gorgeous and fresh now, but far too young. Drink 2022–2040."

There also is a glint of smoke and a touch of lemon zestiness. It is lemon and tangy citrus that takes over on the taut linear palate. Zestiness fizzes and gives the concentrated palate a wonderfully weightless feel that belies the depth of fruit. This is totally appetizing and refreshing with a dry, moreish finish. Drink 2017–2035."

A touch of candied lemon peel makes the nose even more enticing. The palate is generous but dry, showing off the pristine pear fruit and wonderful phenolic texture that gives as much structure to this wine as its fine pure lemony acidity. Savored slowly, the full depth of pure pear fruit becomes apparent. This is a class act just coming into its drinking window now, with ample potential for further aging. Drink 2017–2035."

The palate has a wonderful richness of texture, something earthy with a pithy, beautiful grip. The flavors are still taut, for now (just zesty aromatic orange peel) but much more still hides and sleeps below the surface. This is powerful and concentrated, with a lovely and enduring backbone of freshness. This needs bottle age to come into its own. The finish is fresh, clean and lasting. Drink 2020–2037."

The big bold palate is concentrated and energetic, pervaded by a streak of zesty lemon freshness that keeps this from becoming too rich. There is undeniable drive here, and a very lasting persistent length of peach and lemon flavors which will develop much more with bottle age. Drink. 2017–2037."

The palate comes in with gentle, subdued sweetness, boosting ripe pear notes before revealing fir honey bitterness and tangy grapefruit zest. A warm sandalwood-spiced core is still tightly closed, holding further stores of fruit and spice and signalling lasting power and barely tamed energy. While aromas are enticing now this deserves cellaring to come into its own. There is much drive and a dynamic citrus freshness wills you to sip more. This draws you in dangerously. The finish is dry and totally enticing. Drink 2020–2040."

Fragrant herbs—think chervil and yarrow—also make an appearance. The palate is dry but brims with ripe lemon oil and fresh lemon fruit. This is streamlined and impactful, with a commanding, overarching freshness that only enforces the inherent power of this site more. For now this is tightly wound and still closed, majoring on its ample lemon charm but this needs bottle age to let the myriad notes promised on the nose unfold on the palate. Drink 2022–2040."

They are joined by a tart, aromatic citrus tang of bergamot and citrus foliage. The palate has that same alluring aromatic spectrum that unites utter freshness with exoticism. This seems light but also packs an incredible punch. There is energy and verve on the midpalate, which has an utterly compact, concentrated but fluid texture. Bright zestiness illuminates the entire palate. It's a most unusual and most beguiling Riesling with incredible appeal and potential. Drink 2017–2040."

A hint of grapefruit spice lends added allure. These notes carry to the palate that is juicy in ripe peach, grapefruit and bright lemon. All this happens on an completely dry, finely delineated body of absolute precision and poise. There is something crystalline about this, something fine-boned and delicate that nonetheless has absolute power to convince. This is simply wonderful.

The palate has absolute concentration and energy and more of that smoky promise. This is like the bundled focus of a laser light—incisive, precise and piercing. Notions of peach, lemon and tangerine dance and hover, but the central core and force remains a kind of drive that could move mountains. This is a sleeping giant, absolute and pure, brooding, laying in wait to unleash its might. The palate is absolutely dry, absolutely fresh, absolutely uncompromising. The finish is piercingly clean. Wait for this. Drink 2025–2040 at least."

The palate takes these enticing aromas and bundles them into one arrow-like force of concentrated freshness. This is a high-wire act of piercing brightness and layered citrus aroma. This is like a self-generating well of freshness that convinces with its luminosity, raciness and rapier-like purity of citrus flavors. Everything is heightened: Fruit, dryness, freshness and vibrant verve. It is tempting but it would be a shame to drink this now. Keep this genie in its bottle for a while longer, if only to see what fascinating direction it takes. This is wondrous. Drink 2022–2037."

Wet stone and lemon heighten these perceptions even more. The palate comes in with concentrated zestiness—there almost is a sobering edge of bitter pith that pulls us towards the earth while the soaring lemon and grapefruit notes lift towards the light. This is fruitful promise and airy spirit, earthy depth and boundless richness. All this comes as a bundled force of joy, freshness and utter pleasure. That beguiling, lemony wet stone appears again on the dry intense finish of this elixir-like wine which perhaps has not only captured the light of the sun but that of the stars, too.

A beautifully lithe and fluid synthesis of ripe and tart orchard fruits is leavened by bright citrus, green pear, Cox's apple and pure ripe Amalfi lemon. There also is a fine hint of discreet herbal lift—chamomile and chervil can be glimpsed here and there. What an aromatic, statuesque beauty. Alluring now but absolutely certain to become spectacular with some age. The finish is totally dry, aromatic and long. Drink 2017–2037."

The very dry palate brings all the freshness to the fore—this is lithe and vividly lemony. Exquisite tartness tingles deliciously on the tongue and ripples its vivid rays of shimmering bright light across the senses—what a picture of 2014. If you like it emollient and rounded this is not for you. This is for lovers of bright uncompromising purity and freshness. This has real verve, bags of it, all backed up with serious lemon fruit.

The finish is ultraclean and gorgeously lip-smacking. Totally refreshing now but with great potential. Drink 2017–2037.

The dry palate, with its vivid impression of very pure, bright and incisive lemon freshness, still seems tightly wound. There is something brooding and alive about this—it can be felt below the surface, disquieting but promising. This has barely started on its journey and will take a while to develop fully but it's all already there, dormant and ready to unfurl with a little more bottle age.

The residual sugar is 18%, making it superrich in honeyed sweetness, complexed with apricot, pineapple, pear, vanilla cream and new oak flavors of butterscotch and crème brûlée.

It has the richness of Alsace, but the structure of the Rheingau. And it brings more, because the tight soils of the Hochrain vineyard, with its stony subsoil, brings an intense minerality, which is surrounded by opulent apricot and pineapple fruits. A great wine with enormous potential."

Easily the best Signorello Chardonnay in many years, and a dramatic sign of the quality of the 2007 vintage. Shows intense tropical fruit, mineral and new oak aromas and flavors, with a rich array of dusty Asian spices. Just 72 cases were produced, but it's worth the search."

Just explodes with caramel and pineapple brulée, peach custard, vanilla cream, cinnamon-buttered toast and honey. Almost a food group in itself, this massive wine easily merits its high score, but it will swamp most foods an ordinary Chardonnay would go with.

It shows aromas and flavors of orange cream pie, white peach-infused crème brûlée, honey, butterscotch and toast, firmed up with crisp acidity. Almost a food group in itself, this beauty calls for lobster with melted butter."

The Cuvée Carlotta brings together powerful, smoky new oak with extraordinarily ripe fruit to make for a wine of fantastic opulence and decadence. The flavors are endless, a cascade of pineapple jam, apricot crème brûlée, butterscotch, cinnamon toast, vanilla cream and cotton candy flavors. As sweet as that sounds, the finish is thoroughly dry and very long."

Feels fat and glyceriney in the mouth, providing a decadent palate experience, but acidity contributes to the firm, elegant structure. It should age effortlessly for at least six years, changing and evolving over time."

This gorgeous dessert-style auslese explodes from the glass in a cavalcade of sweet fruit and spice. Honeyed peaches and dried apricots are most prominent, but shadings of cinnamon and allspice give complexity, while crisp acids provide impeccable balance on the long finish. Delicious now, this wine should easily evolve for up to 40 years."

Dry and leesy now, with a mineral compactness, it shows a rich core of baked peach, spiced apple, butterscotch and smoky honey. As it warms in the glass, it develops great flavor and textural complexities. Should come into its own by 2009, and improve for many years after."

The balance strikes you first, with crisp, zesty acidity cleansing the palate and preparing it for the onslaught of flavor. Then a tsunami of grilled pineapples, Meyer lemon pie filling, crème brûlée, butterscotch and vanilla hits. So devastatingly good, you can't keep your hands off it."

This, he believes, gives greater exposure, and therefore heat, for the grapes. Certainly this beautiful wine is richer than the other Bründlmayer Riesling from the same vineyard. But the intense concentration of flavor and beautiful currant and almond flavors are all there."

The vineyard, of course, does the work, but the intensity of the rich fruits is given a fine twist of minerality, of tension, and of firm acidity. This wine will age 5–10 years and beyond.

Acidity stars, giving the wine a brilliant crispness that's so clean and fine. Barrel fermented in one-third new French oak, the wine is incredibly rich and leesy. The terroir has coaxed out complex layers of pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes, apricots and very exotic tropical fruits suggesting golden mangoes and papayas. The oak adds even richer layers of crème brûlée to this vastly enjoyable wine."

There is some botrytis here, but this is not a sweet wine, rather one that shows vibrant fruit, great minerality and structure. It walks a tightrope between superripeness and freshness. With its structure, it should age for 10 years or more."

In its youth this ‘05 is flashy in lemondrop, pear and spicy anise, with a honeyed finish and crisp acidity. It's quite addictively brilliant, a wine whose lush harmony mesmerizes the palate. But Hanzell Chards invariably age well, and this is a wine you can dependably put into your cellar for 5, 10, 15 years, even longer, as it continues to evolve and become more limpid and minerally."

The residual sugar is at 23%, the alcohol a moderate 8%, and the balance impeccable, with a buoyant underpinning to the intense sweetness. It avoids sugary granularity as well, offering seamless, concentrated fruit that piles on flavors of peach, apricot, banana, mango, papaya and melon in wild profusion, trailing into sweet tea and honey. Apart from the winery's Single Berry Select Trockenbeerenauslese project with Ernie Loosen, this is the best dessert wine made in Washington."

Master winemaker Richard Arrowood has pulled out all the stops on this Burgundian-style wine. The flavors, of pineapple custard, lemon meringue, green apple butter, crème brûlée and gingersnap cookie, are balanced by perfect acidity. This is by far Arrowood's greatest Chardonnay in recent memory."

Yes, there are pears and currant fruit flavors, but the wine goes more towards the lime and salt, to fit with its austere structure. Age for at least 10 years."

Dried apricot notes mark the nose, followed by scents of mango, peach and pineapple; this wine virtually gushes with sweet tropical fruit and honey, yet maintains a wonderful sense of balance throughout."

Racy acidity and minerality shoot through the richness. Give this 10 years at least."

This is a huge wine, but one of extraordinary finesse and interest. One reason is winemaker Margo van Staaveren's instinct for controlled tension. Another is the winery's access to fruit from throughout the county. Rich and opulent and powerful, this Chardonnay is, in a word, great."

Shows the prettiest balance of all its parts, and just about as good as California Chard gets. Ripely opulent in tropical fruit, apricot and tangerine flavors and crisp in limey acids, the wine's 50% new oak adds luscious notes of buttercream, toast, smoke and vanilla."

The result is a big, powerful wine that easily absorbs its lavish coat of new oak. The flavors are of candied pineapple tart, Meyer lemon mousse and vanilla custard, with a finish of sweet, crushed Asian spices. Perfect now, and just beginning to gather momentum. Drink through 2011, at least, with proper cellaring."

This comes from a great vineyard in a great Loire year, so it's no surprise that, like many great Loire Chenin Blanc, it promises lengthy aging—15–20 years if you can wait. In the meantime, now it has youthful vigor and freshness. Screwcap. Available in the U.S. from January 2008."

Yet despite that obvious richness on the nose, it's a bit more restrained on the palate than the 2005, with a more powerful structure and marginally less lushness. Not better, not worse, just different: longer on the finish, more tightly constructed and probably longer-lived."

There's a bit of truffle on the nose, but it's not so exotic as the De L'Orée, nor so rich and fat as Le Méal. Finishes with tremendous length and minerality."

Aromas of truffles and honey burst from the glass, while the flavors lean toward peaches and toasted nuts. It's full-bodied and undoubtedly high in alcohol, but there's no trace of heat, and while it's broad and mouthfilling because of its size, it still finishes fresh and minerally."

Chave 2004 Marsanne (Hermitage),France,98,96,2004,Rhône Valley,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/jl-chave-2004-marsanne-hermitage/,"Chave's white Hermitage is even better than his acclaimed red in 2004. It's wonderfully toasty upfront, backed by layer upon layer of honeyed fruit that simply defies description. Yet despite the incredible richness, there's also tremendous focus and minerality, so that the wine never seems overly weighty, and it finishes with great length and intensity. Drink it now, or try it in 15 years; the 1991 is singing now at age 16."

It brings new levels of richness and complexity to a variety that can be simple even in the best of hands. With 15% Sémillon, the wine explodes with zesty tangerine, lemon tart, coconut pie and smoky oak flavors, with an  edge of wintergreen. The finish is absolutely dry. A triumph."

This offering has the house's trademark yeasty, leesy scents, but also layer after layer of dense, slaty fruit balanced by crisp acidity. It's a bit sweet for most dishes, but pairing it with foie gras or mild cheeses will allow it to shine. Should evolve gracefully for decades."

The fruit flavors of green apple, pineapple and lime are underscored by slate-driven minerality, and the wine, although plump and amply endowed, is well balanced, with superb posture provided by sinewy acids. Surprisingly approachable now, but could last as long as 50 years."

Prüm 2005 Graacher Himmelreich Spätlese Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer),Germany,NULL,95,2005,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/joh-jos-prum-2005-graacher-himmelreich-spatlese-riesling-mosel-saar-ruwer/,"Pungent at first, with diesel notes to go with smoky, leesy scents. But give this wine time, because on the palate the quality is immediately obvious. There's great intensity and depth married to elegance and persistence, complexity combined with purity. Flavors of apple, slate and citrus linger seemingly forever. A masterpiece that should easily last until at least 2030."
