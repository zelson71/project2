It shows the earthy quality that marks wines off the estate, with an aroma suggesting a warm bale of hay under the summer sun, a sweet straw and bay laurel scent that adds savory richness to the cherry, blackberry and chocolate flavors. As usual, the tannins are virtual perfection, at once sweet and firm, dense and fine, perfectly in balance with all the fruit and new oak. So young now, a fat little baby of a wine that's irresistible, but will hold and improve well beyond its tenth birthday.","2003","California","Cabernet Blend","https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/harlan-estate-2003-red-napa-valley/"

It's a tough, young wine, dominated by dusty tannins leading to an astringent finish. But it's incredibly fine, showing a balance and grace rare even in Napa Valley.

Only in the mouth can you begin to appreciate the fantastic wealth of flavors. All this richness is reined in by dusty, structured but easy tannins and the oak regimen.

It is only on the palate that the richer and sweeter Auslese character comes to bear—again in the guise of dark, aromatic pine honey. The concentrated, deliciously bitter zestiness of the acidity, paired with the aromatically dark and equally bitter edge of the resinous honey provide a wonderful structure. While sweetness peaks up, it never gains the upper hand. This is a tight-rope walker of a wine with immense balance and poise.

The mouth is sheer heaven; a mile deep in terms of berry flavor and more, but faultless and smooth. Shows outstanding structure and power, and should age well for 15–20 years.

While very young, this holds all it needs for a promising future: A bright core of juicy fruit—think tangerine, tart red apple and ripe yellow pear—as well as the vividly clean and racy freshness of bright lemon.

It's darkly fruited and superripe, yet doesn't lose its essential sense of terroir, remaining marked by scents of pepper and espresso to go with the chocolate and cassis fruit. Velvety in texture, this is the one of Guigal's 2003 Côte-Rôties that demands a few years of cellaring.

It trades textbook minerality for lushness, and the fruit is star quality. In the mouth, there's an explosion of grape matter that leaves coffee, chocolate, peanut brittle and vanilla.

The block is now being replanted. This is the Pinot that established Rochioli's reputation, and the bottling remains a superstar. The '05 is very dry, crisp and full-bodied, with a flood of cherry-pie filling, pomegranate, rhubarb, Beefsteak tomato and flashy new oak. It's young and immature in tannins, and needs cellaring.
