The dense and powerful palate adds a creamy vanilla note and rolls smoothly over the tongue with concentrated mellowness. This still needs time to relax.

Gary Farrell has long had access to their coveted fruit and 2004 is one of his greatest bottlings ever. It may be due to the warm vintage, but the fruit is spectacular, not in your face at the expense of balance, and rich in cherries, cola and cinnamon-infused rum punch.

It shows the power of the grape, the structural verticality, the austerity, but it is also ripe enough to stand alone and shine all by itself.

It's done up in the grand Burgundian way, but all the bells and whistles can't put a dent in the fruit, which is just, well, big and huge.

The fruit is amazingly ripe, a detonation of cherries, cola, raspberries, pomegranates and coffee, with new oaky layers of caramel, toast and vanilla, but it all comes together in a seamless, elegant, complex experience that's a joy to savor.

This is their 30th anniversary bottling, and it's worthy of the tradition. Ultrarich and smooth, with a mouthfeel that's pure velvet, it's fairly thick in tannins now, suggesting cellaring.

The grapes got real ripe up there in the coastal mountains, producing complex blackberry, cherry, cola, rhubarb, pomegranate and spice flavors, but the cool nights preserved vital acidity, and that makes for a rich balance. The wine never gives up its basically silky, elegant mouthfeel.

But in this new vintage it seems to be a bit less in-your-face than previously. There's plenty of wild herb, beef blood and silage to go around; but the flavors are already fully integrated, the wine viscous and plush with an intensely spicy quality. This is beautiful, thick and meaty yet still lifted through the finish, which keeps adding new scents and flavors as it sails along-vanilla, clove and baking spices.","75",96,"Washington","Cayuse 2004 Bionic Frog Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))","Syrah","2004"

It has layers of depth rarely found in any Washington wines, beginning with dense black fruits, black licorice, smoke, pepper and charcoal. The trademark Cayuse herbal/green tea elements are there also, more as hints than as layers. The aging in big neutral barriques has buffed it out; as it breathes in the glass the wine opens beautifully, gaining flesh and density.

"17698","Red","US","Another spectacular Harlan hits the market. It shows the earthy quality that marks wines off the estate, with an aroma suggesting a warm bale of hay under the summer sun, a sweet straw and bay laurel scent that adds savory richness to the cherry, blackberry and chocolate flavors. As usual, the tannins are virtual perfection, at once sweet and firm, dense and fine, perfectly in balance with all the fruit and new oak. So young now, a fat little baby of a wine that's irresistible, but will hold and improve well beyond its tenth birthday.","265",98,"California","Harlan Estate 2003 Red (Napa Valley)","Cabernet Blend","2003"

It's light and delicate, but powerful, and boasts delicious cherry pie, cassis, cocoa, char and spice flavors. It possesses the kind of tannins that are soft and sweet now, but firm enough to hold the wine for many years. Best now, or anytime through 2015.","70",96,"California","Iron Horse 2003 T-bar-T Benchmark Red (Alexander Valley)","Cabernet Blend","2003"
"18586","Red","Australia","One of the more obviously ageworthy offerings from Clarendon Hills, the 2004 Hickinbotham Syrah boasts a wonderfully perfumed bouquet of flowers, minerals and spice. Then it backs up those captivating aromatics with rich blueberry fruit shaded with mint and cracked pepper and a long, firmly tannic and minerally finish.

"18587","Sparkling","US","An astonishingly brilliant bubbly, one of the best ever from Schramsberg or indeed any California winery, this Pinot Noir and Chardonnay blend strikes with sheer beauty. It's so delicate and refined yet so powerful, defining Champagne qualities of finesse and elegance. Rewarding now, but the parts are far from melding. Best 2007–2012.","80",96,"California","Schramsberg 2000 Reserve Sparkling (Napa-Mendocino-Sonoma-Marin)","Sparkling Blend","2000"
"18589","Dessert","US","Over many years Dolce has established itself as one of the top dessert wines in California, and the '02 doesn't disappoint. Enormously rich in apricot, tangerine and roasted coconut flavors, with plenty of botrytis notes, the wine was aged in 100% new French oak, and oozes in sweet vanilla char and crème brûlée.","80",96,"California","Dolce 2002 Late Harvest Wine Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)","Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc","2002"
"18591","Red","US","Stunning. Just magnificent. This is from Tantara's little Bien Nacido block. It achieves wonderfully ripe fruit flavors with clean, balancing tannins and acids to produce the utmost California cool-climate Pinot Noir. Cherries, raspberries, cola, rich new oak and Asian spice flavors all flood the palate, wrapped into a dramatic silky, velvety texture. This is great Pinot Noir.","80",97,"California","Tantara 2004 Evelyn Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)","Pinot Noir","2004"
"18592","Red","Australia","The flagship of the Clarendon Hills line, this comes from a patch of 80-year-old vines that winemaker Bratasiuk claims routinely provides his best fruit. The 2004 is a stunner, yielding up scents of flowers and spice, framed by hints of vanillin oak. It's dense and amply textured in the mouth, packed with wonderfully expressive blackberry and blueberry fruit, then shows layers of rich tannins on the finish that leave no doubt this needs time in the cellar to show its best. This is a tour de force of Australian winemaking that should be consumed 2010–2025.","325",98,"South Australia","Clarendon Hills 2004 Astralis Syrah (Clarendon)","Syrah","2004"
"19475","Dessert","US","This dessert wine has pushed itself to the front of the line of California sweeties, and the '04 is a great bottling. It's enormously sweet in late-harvest character, with apricot liqueur, pineapple tart and vanilla cream flavors that are brightened and boosted with cleansing acidity. So addictively delicious you just can't help yourself.","22",95,"California","EOS 2004 Tears of Dew Late Harvest Moscato (Paso Robles)","Moscato","2004"
"19476","White","France","Mineral and structured, this is a wine that is very linear and almost austere. There is elegance, fruit and wood along with a hint of ripe plums and peaches. But always that minerality, that steely character, which promise long aging.","253",95,"Burgundy","Etienne Sauzet 2004  Chevalier-Montrachet","Chardonnay","2004"
"19477","White","France","This wine is deceptive. At first smell and taste, it doesn't show much—its spice and green-fruit aromas are not at all obvious. It's when you roll it around your mouth, that all the layers of flavor emerge. It is powerful, rounded, but with a fine line of minerality that holds the whole wine on a knife edge. The wood is beautifully judged, the fruit just beginning to develop secondary aromas. Hold for several years.","600",95,"Burgundy","Bouchard Père &amp; Fils 2004  Montrachet","Chardonnay","2004"
"19478","White","France","A fine wine that offers power, generosity and also a chalky, mineral character. No wonder Montrachet is seen as the greatest grand cru—it has structure, concentration, delicious fruit and layers of complexity. It also needs to age. To drink this wine now would be more than a shame.","500",96,"Burgundy","Etienne Sauzet 2004  Montrachet","Chardonnay","2004"
"19479","White","France","As Anne-Claude Leflaive describes it, this wine is all about the complexity of the vineyard's soil. There is minerality and finesse from the chalk, which gives a structure. And at the same time the ripe fruit seems opulent, with vanilla and spice flavors adding something exotic. Age this wine for at least 5 years.","175",96,"Burgundy","Domaine Leflaive 2003 Les Pucelles Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet)","Chardonnay","2003"
"19480","White","France","This comes from high up in the Chevalier-Montrachet vineyard, from vines surrounding a small workers shed, the “cabotte.” It is the better of the two bottlings from this vineyard by Bouchard, although “better” here is like differentiating between two stars on top form. It has great poise, so although the richness is there, it is shot through with acidity and citric flavors that underline the huge, ripe fruit. Age for 10 years for best results.","500",96,"Burgundy","Bouchard Père &amp; Fils 2004 La Cabotte  (Chevalier-Montrachet)","Chardonnay","2004"
"19481","White","US","What a roll St. Jean has been on with Chardonnay. This wine was made from a majority of Robert Young and Belle Terre vineyard fruit, and is two-thirds new French oak. The combination is mind-blowing. The vineyards contribute concentrated spicy, tropical fruit flavors and perfect acid balance, while the oak provides elaborate seasoning. Absolutely delicious. One of the most satisfying Chards of the vintage.","45",96,"California","Chateau St. Jean 2003 Reserve Chardonnay (Sonoma County)","Chardonnay","2003"

"19884","White","France","The richness of this wine envelops you from the start. It is all about opulence, but it's balanced with layers of ripe fruit and wood. At this stage in its long life, this wine from a fine white wine vintage is still dominated by fruit. The secondary flavors will start to show in 3–4 years time. A powerful wine that does not lose sight of a potential partnership with food.","320",95,"Burgundy","Bouchard Père &amp; Fils 2004  Chevalier-Montrachet","Chardonnay","2004"
"19885","White","US","Acidity and minerals are the hallmarks of this exciting Chardonnay. Of course, you'll find the ripe tropical fruit and new oak and lees of other Chardonnays, but it's really that tanginess that attracts. Currently the wine shows primary flavors of mangoes and papayas, but it would not surprise me if it ages well beyond five years.","65",95,"California","Morgan 2004 Double L Vineyard Hat Trick Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)","Chardonnay","2004"
"19886","White","US","This year's Rosemary's is dry, crisp in citrusy acids, and wonderfully complex.

Easily takes its place in the front ranks of California Chardonnay.","45",95,"California","Talley 2004 Rosemary's Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Grande Valley)","Chardonnay","2004"
"19887","White","France","A wine of promise, but still in its infancy. This grand cru, structured and still waiting to open to its full opulence, is packed with concentrated flavors. It's a powerhouse that needs at least five years to even begin to show its structure, ripe fruit and richness.","228",95,"Burgundy","Etienne Sauzet 2004  Bâtard-Montrachet","Chardonnay","2004"
"19888","White","France","It's not so much the fruit but the richness and concentration that mark this wine. Yet it's not superripe because of the hot 2003 vintage. This wine, with its origins in biodynamically grown grapes, preserves a great purity of fruit as it layers intense almond and citrus flavors over vanilla and yellow fruit tastes. It should age well.","113",95,"Burgundy","Domaine Leflaive 2003 Clavoillon Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet)","Chardonnay","2003"
"19891","White","France","This is the one grand cru that is entirely in Chassagne-Montrachet. It's a tiny patch of land (4.13 acres) making wines that are more delicate than the others. With its fine, fresh flavors so light to the taste, this is a wine that floats on the palate with a smooth, silky texture. Wood and white peaches contribute but do not dominate.","250",95,"Burgundy","Louis Latour 2004  Criots-Bâtard-Montrachet","Chardonnay","2004"
"20175","Red","Italy","This wine towers over others in terms of excellence. This blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 10% Syrah and other varieties (that sees 14 months of barrique) is the epitome of grace and elevates wine drinking to almost spiritual heights: The nose is horizontal, wide, vast and infinite with extraordinary tobacco, leather with fine cherry at its core and toasted almond and herbal notes at the extremities.

"20234","Red","US","Oaky, toasty and spicy, this thick, massive Merlot is packed with berries, cherries, plums and chocolate. The Cab Franc adds meaty tannins to the beautiful blueberry, blue plum and blackberry fruit. A sweet, supple Merlot with hints of coffee, black tea and earth.

"20236","Sparkling","France","This is a classic food Champagne, hugely rich, toasty, generous.

"20237","Red","South Africa","This was the first Bordeaux blend from the Cape, and remains one of the very best.

"20238","Dessert","US","This Chardonnay and Riesling blend tastes TBA—totally botrytis affected—which it was, resulting in an intensely concentrated sweet wine. With 10% residual sugar, it has apricot nectar flavors and a dessert pastry, lemon chiffon thing going on.

It floods the palate with cherry pie, cola and mocha flavors, Asian spices and a sweet, smoky, buttery phyllo pastry quality.

Drink now through 2010, but who knows how long it will last.","43",95,"California","Longoria 2004 Fe Ciega Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)","Pinot Noir","2004"

Will develop over many years.","184",95,"Champagne","Deutz 1996 Cuvée William Deutz Brut  (Champagne)","Champagne Blend","1996"
"20242","Red","US","An extraordinary Syrah, from Ciel du Cheval grapes.

"20243","Red","South Africa","All the Bordeaux grapes are here, making this one of the most complete Bordeaux blends from South Africa.

Wow.","16",95,"California","Santa Barbara Winery 2001 Lafond Vineyard Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley)","Sauvignon Blanc","2001"
"20246","Sparkling","France","A powerful Cristal, which has all the richness of the 1999 vintage.

"20248","Sparkling","France","This is a wine that thrives on tension between its structure, opulence, elegance and poise.

"20250","Sparkling","France","Impressively young, this wine shows both the open, tropical side of De Sousa's Champagnes and the firm, closed nature of 1996 bottlings.

"20252","Sparkling","France","The Bollinger R.D. (recently disgorged) is Bollinger's answer to a prestige cuvée. Keeping the wine long on its lees (this was disgorged in June 2006) yields a wine that is very much in the rich Bollinger style.

"22082","Red","US","100% estate grown. More tannic and dense than the Cabernet, this is roughly three-quarters Cabernet, one-sixth Merlot, but replaces that wine's Cab Franc and Carmenère with Petit Verdot.

"22085","Dessert","Austria","What a beautiful wine, with honey, perfumes, acidity and delicate fruit. It is certainly ripe, with tropical fruits and a pure citric streak.

"22086","Red","US","Lovely color and aromatics, this supremely powerful yet graceful wine sends up a mix of plum, berry, dust, mint and menthol. It's spicy and young, and surprisingly light on its feet. The concentration here is different from a top-tier Napa Cabernet; the fruit has a pleasing elegance. The acids are firm but unobtrusive, the tannins are ripe, smooth but substantial, giving the wine some weight and power. As good as anything this superb producer has ever done.","95",97,"Washington","Quilceda Creek 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2003"
"22439","Dessert","Germany","Words hardly do this wine justice. It's unctuous almost beyond the point of being wine—offering a mèlange of dried fruits and honey that ooze over every taste bud, filling the pores of your mouth and then releasing sugar and flavor for minutes afterward. And the aromas aren't too shabby either, giving up intense scents of dried apricots and orange marmalade, tinged with tea-like notes that add a sense of lightness and complexity.","250",97,"Mosel-Saar-Ruwer","Von Othegraven 2004 Kanzem Altenberg Eiswein First Growth Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer)","Riesling","2004"
"22498","Red","US","Tasted with Baldacci's regular Cab, this is a slightly tougher, less immediately opulent wine. The fruit is there, but the tannic structure makes it less accessible. Lush plum and prune flavors coat the palate, dusted with oaky notes of chocolate and smoke. Winemaker Rolando Herrera worked at Stag's Leap Wine Cellars as well as with Paul Hobbs, and he clearly knows his stuff.

"22500","White","Germany","This wine's intense aromas of honey, oranges and tea seem almost a little roasted or caramelized, but on the palate the flavors are brilliantly defined and focused by vibrant acidity that brighten the bold citrus and honey notes.

It's a bit backward, with an earthy, mushroomy, soy and balsamic taste alongside the briary berry flavors. Has an almost feral quality that is quite interesting and different.

"22505","Red","US","Enormously rich in crème de cassis, cherry pie and cocoa flavors, which many Cabs have these days. But what's so special is the tannic structure, which is world class, and could only come from a premier Napa vineyard.

"22506","Red","US","What a spectacular effort. Dense and precise, it explodes from the glass with pure varietal scents and crisp, layered flavors. The mix of red fruits seamlessly weaves into barrel flavors of coffee, toast, caramel and buttered nuts, then adds licorice and spice to the long, clean,  lifted finish. A tour de force.","40",95,"Oregon","Le Cadeau 2003 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)","Pinot Noir","2003"
"22507","Red","US","A Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, the grapes for this stunning wine came from David Abreu's vineyard in the St. Helena foothills. It's very complex, softer, more open and approachable than Colgin's 100% Cabs, with a flamboyant spectrum of cherries,  framboise, cocoa, violets, gingerbread and spices framed in supple, fine tannins. Beautiful, a feminine wine of great beauty. Drink now through 2015.","225",95,"California","Colgin 2003 Cariad Red (Napa Valley)","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2003"
"22508","Red","US","Ripe and flashy, offering tiers of cassis, chocolate and charry new oak flavors, wrapped in sweet, smooth tannins. Has an acidic bite midpalate that balances the lushness, and will add to the wine's cellar-worthiness. Defines sheer power, but never loses control. Best now and through 2017, at least.","500",96,"California","Screaming Eagle 2003 Red Wine Red (Oakville)","Cabernet Blend","2003"
"22509","Red","US","More structured than the Melbury, with deeper, firmer tannins: but it's certainly not a tannic, hard wine. It's the quality of the tannins, fine, ripely sweet, intricate. The flavors are enormously rich in blue and black berries, as well as chocolate. Magnificent wine, fleshy, fat, opulent. As delicious as it is now, should age well through 2020.","225",96,"California","BOND 2002 St. Eden Red (Napa Valley)","Cabernet Blend","2002"
"22510","Red","US","Stunning. Explodes with the most intricately detailed aromas: a perfume of fine smoky oak and ripe black currants. Exudes sheer power, with great weight yet no heaviness.

Floods the mouth with dramatic black currant, cherry and chocolate flavors, masses of toasty, caramelized new oak, and a rich, minerally earthiness.

In the mouth, it's unctuous, and floods the palate with sweet, savory flavors. Has a youthful jamminess right now, which will melt off and refine as time goes by.

Absolutely first rate, as good as anything Napa Valley produces. Compellingly, addictively delicious, but so dry and voluptuous. Classic wine, with perfect alignment of fruit, acids, tannins, oak, alcohol, the works. The grapes are from Sloan's portion of the Sacrashe Vineyard, high above the Silverado Trail in the Vaca Mountains. Mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, aged in 100% new French oak. Perfection in a bottle.

The color is purple-black, and massively saturated. Very intricate, complex, totally enjoyable, almost perfect. Like a great Pauillac, this monumental wine announces cassis, blackberry, cigar box, pencil lead, spice and cedar flavors that go on and on. Very tannic, but so beautiful, and amazingly rich.

"22671","Red","US","Some great Cabs are drinkable when young, while others require patience. This is the latter sort. It's a tough, young wine, dominated by dusty tannins leading to an astringent finish. But it's incredibly fine, showing a balance and grace rare even in Napa Valley. As it warms up and breathes in the glass, it gets even better, giving tantalizing hints of ripe cassis and cherries that now are buried. You could open it now, after decanting, but it should begin to blossom in 2008, and will improve for many years.","100",97,"California","Von Strasser 2002 Reserve Red (Diamond Mountain District)","Red Blend","2002"

In the mouth, this is an immense Cabernet, profoundly deep in blackberry, roasted coffee and dark chocolate flavors. It is also enormously tannic, and is effectively locked down. Nowhere near ready, although decanting will help it, but it's best to hold this magnificent wine until 2007, when it should start to open, and then for at least 10 additional years.","175",95,"California","Diamond Creek 2002 Volcanic Hill Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2002"

"28853","Sparkling","France","A very dry style of Champagne that needs food. At this stage, this wine is young, with vibrant acidity  and dense, green fruit.

But, as so often with a Taylor Fladgate Port, this fruit is balanced out with beautiful perfumes, elegant tannins and complex layers of dryness, sweetness and acidity.

This one feels simultaneously fresh and old as the hills, with a meaty, merdy appeal. Red fruit aromas and flavors are concentrated and sprinkled in black pepper; the tannins are manageable now, but still substantial enough to age.

Still very closed on the nose, showing cassis and black cherry aromas after much airing. Its color is a powerful, almost glowing, purple and its flavors—a vibrant surge of pure black and blueberries—are just as intense. Very concentrated and tight, with a linear, minerally frame underneath its monstrous tannins. Winemaker Roman Bratasiuk recommends aging for a mimum of 6 years before drinking; if you are as foolish as I and insist on opening a bottle today, decant for a minimum of 6-8 hours. Rating may look stingy by the time Bush finishes his second term.","375",95,"South Australia","Clarendon Hills 2003 Astralis Syrah (Clarendon)","Syrah","2003"
"35026","Red","US","Right up there with the best of the ‘01 Napas. Smooth and polished, with a velvety mouthfeel that conveys cherry and blackberry flavors, without heavy extract.

"35028","Red","Spain","This is everything a modern-day super red is supposed to be. It's bold, smoky and masculine beyond reproach. The body is sturdy as a brick, yet it's cuddly and smooth. Flavorwise, you won't believe the cascade of cassis, black cherry, vanilla and licorice that flows from the palate. And the finish lasts an eternity.

"35484","Dessert","US","This flamboyant wine is drenched in new oak the way Hollywood stars used to wrap themselves in mink. It's fabulous, gooey-sweet in apricots, honey, vanilla, peaches and cream and ripe, sweet bananas sautéed in butter. It's all folded into the most unctuous, butter cream texture.

It is rounded, rich, powerful, with a fine sense of the red fruits of Pinot Noir. To add further flavors, there are almonds, creaminess and warmth.

Individual notes (apart from eucalyptus and toast) aren't discernible; instead, it's an intense, penetrating sensation that fills the nose. Vanilla and coffee flavors are sumptuous foils to rich blackberries on the palate, which is muscular and plush as all get-out. Finishes long, with big but soft tannins.

Its blackberry core is juicy without being overblown; black olives, earth, leather and even a little raspberry flesh out the flavor profile. Has a velourlike texture in the mouth; its tannins are soft enough to age well,  but age it certainly needs—it's showing restraint, and will need about 10 years to reach full bloom.

Don't chill this too much, because it will stun the intensely rich botrytis and apricot preserves aromas, with their edge of wild honey and cinnamon.

Along with the power, though, is much of the elegance and poise that characterizes great Saint-Julien.","40",95,"Bordeaux","Château Branaire-Ducru 2000  Saint-Julien","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2000"
"47615","Red","France","Typical of Lynch-Bages in its sumptuous rich style, this is a resounding success for the team of Jean-Michel Cazes.

"47616","Red","France","Madame de Lencquesaing's estate has produced a stunner in 2000. The perfumes, delicate and sensuous, give it class, style and make it very memorable. It is delicious now, but there are tannins there, and deep, intense fruit flavors, waiting to develop slowly and surely.","30",96,"Bordeaux","Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande 2000  Pauillac","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2000"
"47617","Red","France","This is likely to be one of the most long-lived Pomerol from 2000. It has hugely rich fruit, it is has great density. But what will give it its longevity is the layer of tannin that sits, brooding, in the middle of the wine. Don't even attempt to drink before 2012.","130",96,"Bordeaux","Château Trotanoy 2000  Pomerol","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2000"
"47618","Red","France","For an Haut-Brion, this is huge. Every characteristic suggests power, from the dark color, through the knock-out perfumes, full of dark, brooding fruits. The flavors are black, intense and ripe. It is a delicious wine, surprisingly ready to drink. And yes, just at the end, there is a small hint of the delicacy and elegance that is true Haut-Brion.","400",96,"Bordeaux","Château Haut-Brion 2000 Pessac-Léognan  (Bordeaux)","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2000"
"47619","Red","France","This wine is superb. With its power and structure it will age over 20 years or more. Backed by blackcurrant and jelly flavors, it shows great fruity attractiveness even at this early stage in its development. It will develop slowly and evenly to become a reference point for the vintage.","60",96,"Bordeaux","Château Canon 2000  Saint-Émilion","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2000"
"47620","Red","France","Right from the early days of tasting in spring 2001, this was going to be one of the stars of the vintage. And a star it remains. There is big, ripe fruit, with solid, ageworthy tannins. It may not be as powerful as some of the blockbusters of the vintage, but it is certainly more opulent, less classical than Léoville-Barton can sometimes be.","150",96,"Bordeaux","Château Léoville Barton 2000  Saint-Julien","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2000"
"47621","Red","France","With its distinctive antique bottle and gold etched label dominated by a sheep, this is definitely a move away from classic Bordeaux bottling. It is good that the wine can support the presentation. The fruit is so ripe, it almost tastes of raisins, but that sweetness is finely balanced by the dry tannins and concentrated texture. To finish, there are exotic spices, giving an almost oriental character to the long aftertaste.","450",97,"Bordeaux","Château Mouton Rothschild 2000  Pauillac","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2000"
"47622","Red","US","The second wine, and first red, from this famous vineyard-owning family, it's a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc. The wine is, in a word, classic. This great vintage provided super fruit, and the winemaking takes full advantage of it. This is very great Cabernet. It's so delicious you find yourself putting the glass down and thinking about it. A new First Growth enters the California pantheon.","50",97,"California","Robert Young 1997 Scion Red (Alexander Valley)","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","1997"
"47623","Red","France","Denis Durantou's obsessive search for perfection paid off handsomely with this stunning 2000. Despite the richness of the fruit, there is still a sense of lightness to the wine which makes it surprisingly easy to comprehend at this stage. The Cabernet Franc perfumes couterpoint the rich Merlot, while the wood underpins everything.","108",97,"Bordeaux","Château l'Eglise-Clinet 2000  Pomerol","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2000"
"47624","Red","France","In 2000, it seems the Cabernet Franc made Cheval Blanc. It has given a mysterious, wonderful perfume to the intense richness of the Merlot. It has less of the explosive power of Ausone, it is more subtle and elegant, reserving its explosion of richness for the end, when a welter of black fruits seems to go on for ever","700",97,"Bordeaux","Château Cheval Blanc 2000  Saint-Émilion","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2000"
"47625","Red","France","While the first impression with Pétrus is the wood, it is the fruit which gradually shows itself. It is extraordinary, this dense fruit, which simultaneously manages to float with elegance. There is layer after layer of fruit, sometime black, sometimes smoky, sometimes spicy. The wine is not yet totally integrated, still intensely young, with decades to go. But what a development it will be","1500",98,"Bordeaux","Château Pétrus 2000  Pomerol","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2000"
"47626","Red","France","Forget all those garage wines, forget the upstarts of Saint-Emilion. When you want real class, you have to turn to Ausone. What a wine - magnificently dense and opaque, hugely rich and sensual. Yet it doesn't seem in the least decadent - for deep inside the wine is a huge backbone of ripe tannins. Keep for at least 10 years","600",98,"Bordeaux","Château Ausone 2000  Saint-Émilion","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2000"
"47627","Red","France","This is such an expressive wine, with elegance a major factor in its character. It is certainly huge, rich and dense. But there is much more to it. You can peel layers of fruit and tannins away, and still never get to the end of the wine's complexity. At every stage of its life, it will reveal a new character, but for now it is dominated by powerful tannins and huge, black, fruit.","450",98,"Bordeaux","Château Latour 2000  Pauillac","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2000"
"47628","Red","France","Perhaps of all the first growths in the totally un-classic 2000, this retains most of the classic Bordeaux. It is certainly almost black in color, while the new wood flavors are very present. But it shows an impressive restraint, leaving the power of the wine to be revealed over the years rather than immediately. This could well be the longest-lived of the Pauillac first growths.","400",99,"Bordeaux","Château Lafite Rothschild 2000  Pauillac","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2000"

The grapes were mistaken for Zinfandel for decades and sold as such, until recently identified as Petite Sirah, Valdepenas, Mourvèdre and Alicante Bouschet.

Sold under the ancient spelling of the appellation name (Ermitage), they represent the epitome of the power and concentration that lies behind the reputation of the appellation.

A full range of caramel, floral, citrus, forest floor, mustard greens and dried cherry aromas and flavors work in great harmony. The mouthfeel displays a positive, brilliant tension: it's full-yet light, bright and zingy-but even, smooth, yet to some tasters, almost gravelly-textured.

The blend is three quarters Cabernet, with the rest a 50/50 split of Merlot and Petit Verdot.

The palate comes in with a concentrated richness that is as much sustained by residual sweetness as it is by sheer force of fruit: candied lemon and orange, juicy pear, ripe mirabelle and yellow peach. There also is a zesty spicy pithiness on the midpalate that frames and guides the wine alongside invigorating lemon freshness that lets this finish off dry despite the richness.

The lemon notes become even more fully expressed on the taut but full, streamlined but expressive and dry body: they take the rich guise of lemon oil and candied peel. They are utterly tart and fresh but with that golden ripeness at their very core that makes this rather seductive. Taste buds just want to get to the bottom of this and rejoice in the purity and fruity tang. This is translucent and refreshing but also rich and full of delicious lemony vigor.

These opposites play off each other and create something that is alive and vigorous, joyful and precious. There is concentration and poise, structure and texture, but none of this concerns the hedonistic forces at play. They just want to express their careless exuberance. There is something defiant about this dry concentrated wine.

The aromas are reminiscent of evolving Riesling but this is not the only grape in this expressive and highly aromatic field blend. While there is distinct residual sweetness on the palate, this has a counterweight in the rich texture of the midpalate. There is something authentic and deeply comforting and satisfying at the core of this wine that says Alsace. It's impossible to put this wine into a box, it needs to be tasted and enjoyed on its very own terms. The finish is medium sweet, totally soil-driven and very, very long.

"75731","White","France","The heady scent of grapefruit and tangelo peel immediately add savoriness to the crisp green-apple fruit that is evident on the nose. But there are also richer hints of honey and yellow apple. The palate remains taut, slender and linear but that tangelo spice is boosted by enticing herbal notes of yarrow and a dollop of yeast. This is an aromatic marvel. The finish is dry and intense. This will keep your interest for years.

"75732","White","France","There is just a touch of peach amidst the green and yellow apple notes. The palate adds a stony earthy touch, as well as a hint of lanoline, and has an impressive core of fruit that radiates throughout this wine with pure apple flavor and crisp freshness. This strikes a high soprano note of absolute purity. The body is taut and bone-dry, the finish is clean and lasting. Gorgeous now but totally built to last.

"75733","White","France","There is something heady about this: a hint of chamomile tincture and pure lemon zest. The palate cuts in with uncompromising purity and zestiness—this really wants to showcase pure stone and tart citrus. There are glimpses, however, of plump ripe mirabelle plums and a touch of dried pear and quince. Nonetheless, this is governed by stern tanginess and thus is for real adults only. This is dry, slender and shows absolute focus. A celebration of stone and Riesling.

"75741","Red","US","From a selection of the original vines at this heritage vineyard, which was planted in the early 1970s, this is densely layered with strawberry, raspberry and cherry fruit.

The palate reveals a core of stone, chalk and lanolin, all framed with the purest notion of lemon zest. This shows lovely flavors of maturity but has only just got going.

"75743","Red","US","From an organic, dry farmed vineyard, this wine is as feral as the forest—a study in wild boar, wildflowers and dried herbs.

The medium-sweet palate impresses with both fresh and dried notes of fruit: plum, white sultana, white currant and the ripest pear and apple you can imagine. This is full-on and big but balanced by tingling, fresh and precise acidity. A field blend of polar opposites, Riesling and Gewurztraminer, this unites their virtues of aromatic textured richness and poised finesse. Again, this is not a wine that is easily categorized with its medium-sweet, soil- and fruit-driven profile, but it is a joy to experience and savor. The finish lasts and lasts.

A deep, intense nose of cassis, earth, menthol and cedar is followed by a full, rich palate that's supple without being soft. Brighter notes of red fruit emerge on the lengthy finish, which is dominated by sweet fruit and creamy lactones.

Dense boysenberry, black peppercorns, asphalt, charred lamb, dried violets, lilacs and lavender show on the tarry yet floral nose.

The core of this delicately honeyed wine is still vibrantly fruity, concentrated in luscious yellow peach and cherry flavors.

The palate comes forth with a vivid, leafy purity that suggests herbs, freshly turned earth and pure, lifted citrus. All we get right now are the flavors hovering above the core which is still firmly closed. A wealth of apple and citrus fruit is evoked which will awake with time, this is too young to be opened.

The palate bristles with wonderfully tingling citrus freshness that highlights all the aromatic aspects in turn: the fruitiness, the ripeness, the savory backdrop of yeast and the light-footed but concentrated core.

As a drinker you just want to dive into this inviting, fragrant pool of refreshment. There is a powdery edge too, and quite some texture, despite the most slender of bodies.

Together they present an immensely enticing nose, hinting at whole oceans of luscious fruit beneath the surface. The palate then invokes all the varietal spice: white pepper, arugula and chervil, illuminated by bright, zesty citrus to finish in a concert of layered zestiness.

There is a hint of crunchy, crisp green apple combined with far richer notions of lemon zest and mandarin peel. Deeper down resides an earthy, yeasty core and a salty, stoniness.

The palate is more expressive, with sprightly lemon, aloe vera and the soothing notion of ripe green and yellow pears.

From 120 acres, only the best grapes go into this top wine and 2013 was a smaller crop than the average (10,000 to 12,000 cases).

There is a hint of bottle age, giving the wine a toasty complexity that brings a balance to this great wine. Drink now, although this vintage will certainly last to 2020 and beyond.","469",96,"Champagne","Louis Roederer 2007 Cristal Brut Rosé  (Champagne)","Champagne Blend","2007"
"104243","Dessert","Austria","Hints of moss, yeast and freshly zested orange peel edged with pine honey initially suggest a dry wine. It is only on the palate that the richer and sweeter Auslese character comes to bear—again in the guise of dark, aromatic pine honey. The concentrated, deliciously bitter zestiness of the acidity, paired with the aromatically dark and equally bitter edge of the resinous honey provide a wonderful structure. While sweetness peaks up, it never gains the upper hand. This is a tight-rope walker of a wine with immense balance and poise. Glints of vanilla pod, candied peel and white pepper open up, vista after vista. If you are new to Grüner Auslese, this is the one to get you hooked.","40",96,"Wachau","Emmerich Knoll 2013 Loibner Auslese Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)","Grüner Veltliner","2013"

"104246","Sparkling","France","Aged for 10 years before disgorging and a further time before release, this is Gosset's top wine from a great vintage year. Extra Brut means it is dry, although the age of this wine has softened the intense acidity and turned it into an elegant, mature wine of great complexity as well as immediate attraction. It will age further at least until 2022, although it is totally drinkable now.","195",96,"Champagne","Gosset 2002 Celebris Vintage Extra Brut  (Champagne)","Champagne Blend","2002"
"104247","White","US","To tame Durell is no easy feat—indeed at first this wine exudes matchstick and robustness on the nose and palate.

"104248","Dessert","Austria","The perfume of fully ripe, lusciously juicy peach is nearly overwhelming. It is joined by notions of barley-sugar and candied apricot. There is a more tart notion of passion fruit, too, as well as a guiding, lightning flash of welcome acidity that brings a punch of citrus zest. This TBA is like a very potent flavor bomb that not only delivers luscious sweetness but also a counterpoint of acidic thrill. Needless to say, this simply lingers and lasts. Nectar indeed.","45",96,"Burgenland","Kracher 2012 Nouvelle Vague Nr. 6 Grande Cuvée Trockenbeerenauslese White (Burgenland)","White Blend","2012"

"104250","Sparkling","France","Following on from the great 2002 vintage of this wine, the 2004 is equally memorable. It is a magnificent wine, structured and beautifully balanced between the ripe white fruits and the tight texture that will allow it to age many years.

It has weight and richness with a soft, fruity dosage that gives touches of yeast and fragrant acidity.

"118933","White","Austria","Yellow plum and Amalfi lemon lead a merry dance on nose and palate. A yeasty edge pulls them down to earth, but their exuberance is evident, swirling and barely contained. This is lively, refreshing and totally invigorating. A celebration of ripe citrus draws a dynamic and dizzying fault line across the palate. Currently, minerality lurks in the background while the fruit dances. This will change intriguingly with time.","70",95,"Wachau","Franz Hirtzberger 2013 Hochrain Smaragd Riesling (Wachau)","Riesling","2013"
"118934","Red","Austria","Right now this speaks of earth, forest floor and oak leaf—but not in a mature way. This Pinot takes time to show the glorious red cherry that is there in abundance, caressed by gentle, smoky oak. This will take time to blossom but will reward patience.

"118941","Red","Chile","Cool aromas of cola, coffee, blackberry, stewed plum, herbs and minerals make for a highly attractive and complex bouquet. In the mouth, wall-to-wall power and tannins suggest that this needs a few more years to mellow out. Flavors of stewed plum, blackberry, Carolina barbecue sauce and a hint of citrus peel are complex and set up a deep finish with dark flavors and intensity to spare. Drink from 2016 through 2025.

And when you taste this 100% Chardonnay, you understand why. It's dry and rich in acidity, with yeasty lees and toast that frame gorgeous tangerine, Meyer lemon, lime and vanilla bean flavors. The mousse is ultrarefined, making it great for drinking now.

That combination of opposites gives it intellectual interest, a wine worth thinking and talking about. Technically, it's dry, fairly high in alcohol and oaky. The 100% Cabernet grapes off the estate are incredibly concentrated in black currants and cassis, showing their sunny, high elevation origins on Pritchard Hill. The wine is not perfect. There's a certain hollowness mid-palate, which has to be attributed to the challenging vintage.

A blend of fruit from Atlas Peak and Rutherford, the wine is a barrel selection from the winery's regular 2010 output, and accounts for only about 20% of total production. The Cabernet Sauvignon is mixed with a little Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. It's delicious in blackberry, cassis liqueur, dark chocolate and oak flavors, and well structured in acids and tannins.

Huge fruit and huge oak combine in a full-bodied, richly textured package that delivers waves of toasted coconut, vanilla and intense dark berries yet remains embryonic more than five years after the harvest.

"139589","Red","US","Jim Clendenen is producing the greatest, most exciting Nebbiolos in California, and this wine, tasted at about eight years of age, is, in a word, fantastic. Major kudos to him for aging it this long before commercial release. Although there are still firm tannins, and Nebbiolo's acidity of course makes the wine highly strung to the point of tense, it is immensely drinkable now. You'll find waves of dried cherries, with hints of rose petal, tobacco, white pepper and exotic spices, especially cloves, wrapped into a texture as gently silky as a great Pinot Noir.

"139657","Red","US","Showing precision craftsmanship, this wine hails from a tiny vineyard on Napa's famed Diamond Mountain. Only 225 cases were produced, but it's worth a search if you're looking for classic mountain Cabernet capable of extended aging. The wine has a linearity that defines elegance, yet is rich in blackberries and cassis, with oak nuances. Containing small quantities of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot for complexity, it will reward aging until at least 2018, and should be going strong in 2030.","80",96,"California","Dyer 2010 Dyer Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2010"
"139658","Red","US","This Pinot Noir is insanely delicious. The wine is dry, tart and moderate in alcohol, giving it the smooth silkiness you want in a fine Pinot. The flavors are something else, striking the perfect balance between ripe raspberries, earthy cola, red licorice and mushrooms, with all kinds of spicy complexities. The acid-tannin balance is impeccable.

"139661","Sparkling","US","A stunning wine, exactly 50-50 Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. This vintage was a successful one for Iron Horse, proven again with their release of this LD, after aging on the lees for nine years. The mouthfeel is soft and creamy, with a refined mousse.

The oldest of the Cayuse vineyards, it's really coming into maturity, delivering a tour de force performance in this new vintage.

It shows a fantastic array of blackberries, dates and dark chocolate, with fascinating notes of lavender and dill. The tannins are gorgeous, the acidity fine, and the application of oak is deft.

After disgorgement it was given another five months to sit in bottle before release.

In fact, it's so classic, you could use it in a winemaking class to teach future vintners about how great Napa Sauvignon Blanc should taste. It's bone dry, brilliantly crisp with acidity and gently touched by oak. The main notes are of lees, which give a sourdough tang, and layers of lemons, limes, pink grapefruits, gooseberries and rich tropical fruits.

There's an impressive balance between ripe fruit and crisp acidity, rich and food friendly, but also a fine apéritif.

"140556","Red","US","You'll find the hard tannins associated with Diamond Creek's Cabs, as well as an iodine, metallic brittleness to this wine. The combination of the two makes this as tough as any young Napa Valley Cabernet could be.

Then the flavors fantail out, suggesting cherries, cola, currants and spices that are rich and complex through the long finish. For all its richness, the wine retains an agreeable delicacy of texture. Comprised of lots selected by winemaker Bob Cabral for this anniversary bottling, it's right up there with Williams Selyem's best 2010 Pinots, and just as ageable. Drink now–2022.

Brisk in acidity, balanced in alcohol and oak, it displays a complex array of flavors, ranging from black cherries and cola to pomegranates, rhubarbs, persimmons and sweet currants.

The palate offers waves of ripe blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate and smoky oak flavors. What's harder to put into words is the elegance and balance.

Yet appealing as it is now, there are multiple subtleties waiting to be discovered, and the wine has a fine future. Like all of Marimar's Pinots, it's a big wine—rich and extracted and dense in weight. The flavors veer towards ripe pomegranates, black cherries and sweet licorice, with hints of dark chocolate, orange peel and even the umami of charcuterie. Despite the weight, it magically remains lithe, like a ballerina leaping into the air.

The vintage was cool, too, so the wine is brisk in acidity and low in alcohol, but it still tastes amazingly ripe and complex. The wine dazzles with waves of black raspberry jam, sweet olive tapenade, sautéed brown mushroom, root beer, moo-shu plum sauce and mocha. If those flavors sound like they don't go together, just try the wine. It's seamless and compelling.

It suggests enormous blackberry and creamy-sweet chocolate, larded with bacon and sprinkled with black pepper—and that doesn't even begin to describe the toasty sweetness of the 100% new oak barrels. This is the best California Syrah of the vintage, and one of the greatest Syrahs the state has ever produced.

Even if you knew nothing of the wine's pedigree, you'd be dazzled by its sheer richness of raspberry, cherry, cola and herb flavors, plus the firm, stone-driven minerality, the dryness, the feral mountain hints, the acidity and the overall dazzling structure. The alcohol level is comparatively restrained, providing just the right touch of warmth. New oak clocks in at only 30%, imbuing the wine with a nice seasoning of smoke. Definitely worth searching for, but only 375 cases were produced. Drink this wine now–2022.","70",97,"California","Failla 2010 Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)","Pinot Noir","2010"

Schram, but then the blend is the complete opposite. This one's mainly Pinot Noir, with the balance from Chardonnay. The Pinot Noir brings a warm, raspberry- and cherry-sauce richness to Chardonnay's limes and pears, while an extraordinarily delicious toastiness pervades the whole, as if it had been gently smoked. So enticing now, it's hard to keep from drinking the whole bottle, and you certainly can, but this is a wine that will age for 10–15 years.","110",98,"California","Schramsberg 2004 Reserve Sparkling (Napa-Mendocino-Sonoma-Marin)","Sparkling Blend","2004"

"158388","Sparkling","US","Made entirely from Chardonnay, it shows real delicacy and richness, with a mousse as smooth as fine satin.

"158389","Red","US","This is a really impressive launch for this new brand. Although the bottle doesn't bear a vineyard designation, it's 100% Cabernet from the Morisoli Vineyard in Rutherford, which has produced superb Cabernets in the past from the likes of Meander, Galleron, V. Sattui and Sequoia Grove. Dry and full bodied, it has flavors of sour cherry candy and cassis that often define Rutherford, which are all wrapped into smooth, supple tannins.

Using grapes sourced from the high-density Monte Lodoletta vineyard, this inky, dark expression oozes with syrupy tones of maraschino, dark chocolate fudge, cinnamon spice, crushed clove and barbecue smoke. In keeping with the wine's legendary reputation for long aging potential, the tannins are rock solid at the moment.","530",95,"Veneto","Dal Forno Romano 2006  Amarone della Valpolicella","Corvina","2006"
"158394","Red","France","Very structured and firm, this has the weight, richness and power that is typical of Echézeaux.

It would be a tragedy to open this 100% Cabernet before 2018, and even then it might be too early.

This Syrah emphasizes fruit, not funk, with opulent flavors of black fruit, dried cherry, fig and plum. The 30 months it spent in two-thirds new French oak adds dark streaks of coffee and cocoa.

However, as the tannins are fierce, it's not a wine you want to drink anytime soon. Through the astringency shines a bright, burning core of perfectly ripe blackberries and savory black currants.

"158502","Red","US","This is the most expensive Pinot Noir Foxen has ever made, and guess what? It's also the winery's best. It bears rich flavors, offering tiers of smoky cherries, red currants, licorice candies, vanilla, sandalwood and spices. What's harder to describe is the sheer beauty of the texture and balance. Containing the explosive richness of a wine like this is a challenge, but winemaker Bill Wathan has managed to bring elegance to its power. The wine is high in alcohol, and it's not advisable to age it beyond 3 or 4 years, but it is incredibly delicious.","85",96,"California","Foxen 2010 Sea Smoke Pinot Noir (Sta.

"159753","Red","US","This is an absolutely beautiful wine to drink now, but the richness comes at the price of considerable alcohol. The color is dark and impenetrable, the aromas huge in Cabernet-inspired blackberries and black currants, with a touch of something herbal and also a stony minerality. There's also a fascinating peatiness, like an Islay Scotch. It really opens up in the glass, becoming ever more complex.

"159756","Red","US","You will want to age this Cabernet—8 or 10 years of development is the only way to allow the hard tannins to begin to melt away, allowing the fabulous core of blackberries, currants and dark chocolate to emerge. It's hard to exaggerate the wine's depth; it's so elegantly pure, concentrated and focused.

"159893","Red","US","This portion of the winery's vineyard always yields Cabernets of enormous concentration with hard tannins. The 2009 is a classic, detonating in the mouth with laserlike blackberry and cassis flavors, to which new oak brings additional richness of smoky cedar.

It's noted the vines were planted in 1970, and the wine does have that old-vine concentration of fruit in the form of massively intense blackberries. Then there's the smoky new oak, which adds such a lusciously sweet jacket of buttered toast. Tannic and tight in the way of Diamond Mountain Cabernets, this should begin to come into its own after 2016.","80",95,"California","Von Strasser 2009 Spaulding Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2009"
"159895","Red","US","Showing lovely silkiness, dryness and transparency, this is a Pinot to drink now or age for a while.

"159896","Red","US","The winery held this back an additional six months after their other 2008 Pinots were released, presumably to let it become integrated. Still, it's quite tannic, with a sandpaper-like toughness. Despite the astringency, the massive wild-cherry, cola, mushroom and anise flavors come through. It's a huge wine, feral and untamed—quite exquisite in its wildness. So delicious now, it's hard to resist, but the wise collector will cellar it for 4–5 years, maybe even longer.","49",95,"California","Marimar Estate 2008 Cristina Don Miguel Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)","Pinot Noir","2008"

It shows the hard tannins that always mark the winery's Bordeaux-style red wines, but it's luscious and deep in berry fruit, licorice, grilled meat and cola.

"159898","Red","US","This is a big Pinot Noir, with an explosive intensity of cherries and raspberries that is ripe and pure. Oak, of course, is there too, in the form of buttered, smoky toast. However, the wine isn't a mere fruit bomb. It has interesting nuances of earthy things, like mushrooms, nettles and Provençal herbs. The silky texture is an exquisite balance of acids and tannins.

"159899","Red","Italy","One of the top, if not the top, red wines from Umbria. The naturally tannic Sagrantino grape is softened by the careful oak aging that adds layers of chocolate and spice to the grape's aromas of black cherry, tobacco and leather.

It's seemingly sweet and dry at the same time, and the tannins, which are extraordinarily thick, are fine and pure. Irresistably delicious now, this changes in the glass by the second.

"161184","Red","Italy","An iconic wine from the 2001 vintage, this shows tertiary aromas of dried fruit, cassis, ginger, cola and licorice.

"161185","Red","US","A top-notch vintage for this bottling, it's a blend of 39% Merlot (from the original 1976 block), 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Petit Verdot and 11% Cabernet Franc. Roses, blackberries, cassis and baking spices are beautifully rendered in a wine rich in depth and detail. More bottle age will surely bring greater complexity and soften the astringent tannins.","38",95,"Washington","Seven Hills 2009 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain)","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2009"

"161190","Red","US","A blend of 65% Merlot, 29% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6% Petit Verdot, this is slightly more open and accessible than the companion Cabernet Sauvignon, but it's clearly structured for cellaring.

"161203","Red","US","Quilceda Creek's Red Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon opens with a dense, exotic and luxurious nose: a mix of roasted coffee, dark fruit and Asian spice. At first it's quite dense and unyielding, but it opens slowly over a period of days—not hours—remaining dense and compact, with a remarkable array of dark fruits and barrel flavors. As with its companion reds from Quilceda Creek, this is a wine to cellar for decades.","110",96,"Washington","Quilceda Creek 2009 Galitzine Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2009"

It's fantastically rich, a wine of deliriously decadent flavors, ranging from blackberry jam and crème de cassis to mocha, blueberry extract and buttered cinnamon toast. Yes, it's soft, but it's the softness of fine velvet. After all that richness, the finish is amazingly dry.

"161207","White","US","The cold and fog actually helped this Chardonnay, which achieves a remarkable delicacy and tartness despite the power of its fruit. Really remarkable for the flood of golden mango, Asian pear and Key lime pie richness, which is grounded by a firm minerality. Oak influence and aging on the lees lend the perfect touches of smoky, buttered toast and zesty creaminess to this dry, polished wine. A mere 587 cases were produced.","50",97,"California","Dutton-Goldfield 2010 Dutton Ranch Rued Vineyard Chardonnay (Green Valley)","Chardonnay","2010"
"161208","White","US","A spectacular Chardonnay—this is dazzingly beautiful and mesmerizing in its appeal.

"161209","Red","US","This is the best bottling of a very fine lineup from Leonetti. Dense, textural and complex, it showcases exceptional blending of flavors from the addition of just 7% Merlot, 4% Carmenère and 1% Malbec.

"161210","Red","US","A bold, muscular, striking wine with nerves of steel, this offers a dense, demanding array of black fruit threaded with veins of espresso, smoke, tar, tobacco and iron. As it bursts with exotic barrel flavor, the fruit seems a bit buried, but time after time these wines unfold over the course of decades into glorious maturity. These are arguably the most long-lived and cellarworthy wines in Washington—if not in the entire country.","135",98,"Washington","Quilceda Creek 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))","Cabernet Sauvignon","2009"
"161211","Red","US","The second release of Figgins—a single wine produced by Leonetti's Chris Figgins—is astonishing. Tasted in a lineup of exceptional Walla Walla reds, it outshined them all. It's a sophisticated blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Merlot, from the Figgins Vineyard, with gorgeous aromas of flowers, spices and black fruits. Seamless and long, complex and forceful without being overpowering, it can stand alongside top tier Bordeaux costing four or five times as much.","85",98,"Washington","Figgins 2009 Estate Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2009"

"162587","Red","US","This Cabernet-Merlot blend is packed with blackberry and crème de cassis, with a firm minerality. With the weight of the middle palate and the long, spicy finish, it's especially attractive, although it's also quite tannic. The only difference between this Estate Monte Bello Cabernet and Ridge's Monte Bello Estate Cabernet ($150; note the difference in the placement of ""estate"") is that the winemaker selected lots from the vineyard that were considered more accessible, which in this case means more luscious. Despite its many charms, the wine should age for a long time.","40",95,"California","Ridge 2009 Estate Monte Bello Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2009"
"162588","Red","Portugal","With its concentration and dark tannins, this is a wine that will need many years of aging. It is a serious combination of great style and great power.

"162589","Red","US","A brilliant Pinot Noir from Siduri; it's arguably their best of the vintage so far. Made from the highly regarded Hirsch Vineyard, it has a delicate body that explodes with flavors of tart, wild red berries, cola, baking spices and assorted forest-like notes—like pine needles, mushrooms and mulchy undergrowth. Just gorgeous now, and it should hold and develop over the next 6-8 years.","50",95,"California","Siduri 2010 Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)","Pinot Noir","2010"
"162590","Red","US","This is fabulously rich and spicy, showcases flamboyant flavors of blackberry jam, mocha and cedar, flecked with minerality and wrapped into refined tannins.

"162591","Red","US","This is dry and brisk in acidity, with firm tannins and great structural integrity.

"162593","Red","Argentina","This wine takes you on a trip to an outer wine world where deep, cushioned berry aromas come with exotic perfumes, bath oils and crushed flower petals. It's ultrasaturated and jammy, but not clunky or heavy. This tastes like a storm of blackberry, espresso and Swiss chocolate, while black spices and length bring up the rear. A blend of 50% Malbec, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cab Franc; drink now–2017.","50",96,"Mendoza Province","Riglos 2009 Gran Corte Las Divas Vineyard Red (Tupungato)","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2009"
"162594","Red","US","We can quibble over whether the cherries are red or black, or if it's persimmons or pomegranates, or if the mushrooms are fresh or sautéed, but that's the point. This wine is so complex, it initiates discussion.

"162595","Red","US","Another fabulous Cardinale, better than the 2007 but short of the perfect 2006. This is so complete; it tastes like Cabernet on a cloud, light but ethereal, with ripe, polished blackberry and cherry flavors and touches of mocha, spice and cedar.

"163898","Red","US","This reserve tastes oakier and stronger than Jarvis's regular 2006 Cabernet. With near-perfect balance, this is awesome. Flavors of blackberries and black currants are complexed with minerals and herbs and indefinable things from the soil. It's hard in tannins and rich in spicy, smoky new oak. Hold until at least 2014, and it should continue to age well beyond that.","245",96,"California","Jarvis 2006 Estate Grown Cave Fermented Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2006"
"164095","White","US","A splendid Chardonnay, rich, vital and elegant, with so many layers of interest. Framed by a cut of brilliant acidity, it evolves with complex flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, minerals, flowers and honey, then finishes long and savory in a swirl of spices. Oak adds the perfect touch of buttered toast, while the wine is a study in the creamy effect of sur lie aging. It's perfectly dry on the finish.","50",96,"California","Lynmar 2010 Susanna's Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)","Chardonnay","2010"
"164096","Red","US","The blend is mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other four classic Bordeaux varieties added for complexity. The grapes were sourced from vineyards throughout Sonoma County, and the finished wine was aged in 75% new oak. It's very fine, with concentrated, intense blackberry, cherry and crème de cassis flavors.Minerality, in the form of granite, lends a lick of stone. It's still extremely tannic, and needs much more timebefore it begins to come around.","450",96,"California","Verité 2007 La Joie Red (Sonoma County)","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2007"
"164097","Red","US","Clover, white pepper, and a whiff of animal make this blend of 75% Mourvèdre, 20% Syrah and 5% Grenache compelling now, but it's certainly a wine to cellar. The aromas move through a spectrum of flower, spice, fruit and animal.

"164098","Red","US","A fabulous Pinot Noir that's rich and deeply flavored, with the most wonderful structure. After a fruity, spicy entry, the wine sinks down dramatically on the midpalate, offering masses of cherries, raspberries, red currants, cured meats, sautéed mushrooms, spices and sweetly toasted sandalwood. Bone dry, and capable of aging eight years in the cellar, it surpasses even the 2007 West Slope, arguably making it one of the greatest Carneros Pinot Noirs ever made.","100",97,"California","Donum 2009 West Slope Estate Pinot Noir (Carneros)","Pinot Noir","2009"
"164099","Red","US","A spectacular wine that defines the upper limit of California Bordeaux-style blends. Based on Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with splashes of Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec, this is delicious and complex, offering a blast of blackberry, blueberry-concentrate and mineral flavors. Comprised of fruit grown throughout Sonoma County, this is a masterpiece of the art of blending. Absolutely dry and very hard in tannins, drink this from 2013–2022.","450",97,"California","Verité 2007 Le Desir Red (Sonoma County)","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2007"
"164100","Red","US","The 2008 vintage presented challenges for Cabernet Sauvignon, but this Cabernet Franc-based blend succeeds wildly. It's bone dry, tannic and enormously complex, with flavors of sour-cherry candy, red currant, licorice and spicy cola. Ninety-five percent new oak lends this a wonderful toastiness. Few wines could handle that much new wood, but this one can. However, it's very tannic. You can drink it now, but it should blossom after 2014.","450",97,"California","Verité 2008 Le Desir Red (Sonoma County)","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2008"
"164101","Red","US","A tremendous achievement in Merlot. The vineyard, around 1,600 feet up on Mt. Veeder, is now owned by the Jackson family, and the winemaker is Chris Carpenter, who oversees Cardinale. In fact, this Merlot bears an uncanny resemblance to Cardinale in the dramatically ripe, sweet fruit and superb, tannin-based structure. It's 100% Merlot, with hefty yet balanced alcohol, and the wine easily handles the 85% new French oak in which it was aged for 22 months.","60",98,"California","Mt.

"164102","Red","US","The 2006 vintage was erratic, but Nick Goldschmidt has pulled a rabbit out of a hat with this fabulously complex and rewarding 100% Cabernet. It's classic Oakville, dry, tannic and elegant, and the way the blackberry and black currant flavors marry the new oak is simply wonderful. The Game Ranch Vineyard has been source to some of Goldschmidt's greatest Cabernets over the past decade.

"164103","White","US","Shows classic, full-throttle notes of tropical and citrus fruits, pears and sweet green apples, combined with strong minerality and complex layers of buttered toast, honey and creamy lees. The description alone hardly does justice to the wine's beauty. The acidity is perfect, the oak deftly applied, the finish long and completely satisfying.

"164104","Red","US","This wine dazzles with perfection. Sourced from vineyards throughout Sonoma County, it refutes the belief that a great Cabernet must come from a single vineyard. It does not. The master's art of blending, coupled with demanding vineyard practices lends completeness. The blend is 85% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Malbec, making it an extraordinary success despite the absence of Cabernet Sauvignon. Give credit to winemaker Pierre Seillan. The wine itself is absolutely dry. It starts with a tug of tannins, baring flavors of blackberries, black currants, minerals and new oak, with earthy, herbal and meaty complexities. This is a magnificent wine; it dazzles now and should evolve over the next 6–8 years.","450",100,"California","Verité 2007 La Muse Red (Sonoma County)","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2007"
"164124","Red","France","A prodigious effort, the 2009 Vieilles Vignes from Grand Veneur includes a whopping 40% Mourvèdre in the blend (there's also 10% Syrah, with the balance being Grenache), which no doubt accounts for its dark flavor profile. This is a full-bodied, lushly textured, expansive wine, with a finish that seems to go on forever.

"165159","Red","US","A lovely Cabernet, richly attractive and deeply flavored in blackberries, blueberries and black currants. Made from vineyards scattered across Napa Valley, the wine has been blended with a splash of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. It shows a dramatic structure marked particularly by firm, smooth tannins, and it finishes dry. Shows the stuffing to age for 10-plus years, but it's polished enough to drink now, after decanting.","170",95,"California","Yao Ming 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2009"
"165160","Red","Portugal","Here is a powerful, dense wine, with modest alcohol— thanks to the Dão's mountain climate and granite soil.

"165161","Red","US","This rich wine is a great success. It's enormously rich, almost flamboyant in blackberry jam, blueberry cobbler, anise and smoky new oak, as delicious as any Cabernet out there. Yet it shows a fine structure and relatively modest alcohol, a feature of the 2008 vintage. Good as it is now, you can safely cellar it for the rest of this decade and watch it evolve.","85",95,"California","St. Supéry 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2008"
"165162","White","US","A brilliant Chardonnay, displaying both the terroir of this fine upland part of Monterey County, and the cool vintage that let the grapes hang on the vines until they were perfectly ripe. Dazzles with pineapple and mango fruit, with a perfect jacket of sweet, vanilla-scented oak. Best of all is the acidity, which is brisk, bright and clean.","45",95,"California","Roar 2010 Sierra Mar Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)","Chardonnay","2010"
"165163","Port/Sherry","Portugal","A powerful, almost black-colored Port. It has the richness of the vintage allied to ripe blackberry flavors, and a mineral, tannic structure. Its great fruit makes it almost drinkable now, but aging will add so many more dimensions.","90",95,"Port","Niepoort 2009 Vintage  (Port)","Port","2009"
"165164","White","US","An astonishing wine, creamy and loaded with lush fruit flavors. The tropical fruits are just the beginning; layer upon layer of marshmallow, whipped cream, brioche, butterscotch, buttered nuts, toast and more keep piling on.

"165166","Red","US","A massive wine, decadent and splendid, and a worthy followup to the near-perfect 2008. Densely packed in fruit, it explodes in blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, minerals and sweet, toasty new oak. That richness is lifted to brilliance by the tannic structure, which is world class. So deliciously approachable, it's drinkable now, but it should develop over the next 6–8 years. Beyond that, all bets are off, because this modern style of soft, relatively high-alcohol wines has yet to prove itself over the long haul.","135",96,"California","Venge 2009 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2009"
"165167","Red","US","With the 2009 vintage, De Loach is at the top of its Pinot Noir game, and this one, from a chilly vineyard south of Sebastopol, is among its best ever. The crisp acidity, like a squirt of lime, that accompanies the raspberry, cherry and persimmon fruit is bracing. Meanwhile, a mushroomy earthiness gives complex layers that don't stop. It should age through the next decade.","45",96,"California","De Loach 2009 Pennacchio Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)","Pinot Noir","2009"

Made from mountain vineyards on Atlas Peak and benches in the Rutherford appellation, it combines intensity with elegance. Bursts with upfront, delicious blackberry, crème de cassis and dark chocolate flavors that are wildly sweet on the midpalate, but then finish thoroughly dry. Structure comes by way of a tangy minerality and finely laced tannins. This is one of those wines that is softly decadent from start to finish, although it's probably not one to hold much beyond six years.","625",97,"California","Yao Ming 2009 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2009"

"167594","Red","US","You don't have to age this wine—Jarvis did it for you, holding it back more than five years before release, which is a very expensive proposition for a winery. It's a splendid Cabernet, with the tannins soft and velvety.

Especially noble is the tannin structure, firm and soft, dry and sweet, a combination of opposites. The depth is vast, and the spicy finish goes on for a long time, suggesting the wine's concentration.

The tannins are obvious, but sweetly ripe and soft. A brilliant evocation of Napa Cabernet, despite a high production level of nearly 30,000 cases, which is about the same size as a Bordeaux first growth.

"174874","Red","US","From the oldest block of the estate's Seven Hills Vineyard, this pure Cabernet opens with intense aromas of mountain fruit. Bramble, light herb, cement, black cherry and cassis combine in a polished, elegant wine that probes deeply into the palate.

"174911","Red","US","A powerful, concentrated Cabernet Sauvignon. Impressive for the sheer density of fruit, namely blackberries, cherries and chocolate, accented with buttery, caramelized new oak perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume. The tannins are soft, sweet and intricate. Despite the richness, There's a firm minerality that adds to the structure and grounds it. So opulently delicious, you could drink it now, and it should develop in the bottle over the next six years, at least.","125",95,"California","Maybach 2008 Weitz Vineyard Materium Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2008"
"174912","Red","US","One sip is all it takes to fall in love with this Cabernet, which contains a little Merlot. It's rich and lush and authoritative on every level. The texture is soft as velvet, but the tannins are firm, backing up blackberry, cherry, chocolate, cassis, mineral and new oak flavors that are complex and linger long into the spicy finish. Such are the tannins that the wine is likely to age well through 2016, at least.","75",95,"California","Moone-Tsai 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2008"
"174913","Red","US","A rare Cabernet Franc from Merry-vale, and a spectacular one. They've handled this finicky variety just right, although surely the addition of some Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec adds weight and tone. The wine is dry, richly tannic and enormously flavorful, offering waves of cherries, red currants, red licorice, cola, sweet cedar wood and even savory hints of bacon. A tremendous Cabernet Franc that will stand as a definitive version in California.","90",95,"California","Merryvale 2008 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley)","Cabernet Franc","2008"
"174914","Red","US","Good concentration, with tight-knit purple and black fruit flavors, a streak of espresso, and the characteristic herb and mineral flavors of the vintage.

"174918","Red","US","Here's one of the most ageworthy wines of the vintage. A 100% Cabernet, its grapes come from a vineyard in eastern St. Helena, off the Silverado Trail. Cab's usual blackberries and cassis are there, along with classic elements of green olives and herbs, with a funkiness that adds an umami tang. Very finely constructed, very complex, spicy and delicious. Give it six years, at least.","125",95,"California","D.R.

"174919","Red","US","Januik's reserve is a blend of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, and 2% Cabernet Franc. Sourced from Champoux and Weinbau, just three barrels were made. The fruit is deeply flavored with black cherry and cassis, and the tannins seem darker, earthier, toastier and overall fuller than any of the other excellent Januik reds. Still young and tight, this promises to blossom over time with floral, earth, barrel and spice highlights.","65",95,"Washington","Januik 2008 Reserve Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA))","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2008"
"174920","Sparkling","US","Don't even think about opening this brut for at least six years and probably far longer. Made from 85% Chardonnay and 15% Pinot Noir, it's rich and full-bodied, with elaborately ripe flavors of tangerines, raspberries, roasted almonds and coconut, brioche, honey and vanilla. Good as it is, it simply needs time for everything to transmute into magic.","100",96,"California","Schramsberg 2004 J. Schram Sparkling (North Coast)","Sparkling Blend","2004"
"174921","Red","US","It's hard to exaggerate the purity of this wine, which is 100% Cabernet. It startles for the intensity of mountain blackberries and raspberries, and then a firm minerality kicks in, along with the tannins, providing grounding structure. The finish lasts for a full minute.

"174924","Red","US","A huge wine, fat with the characteristic Cayuse funk, and accented with plenty of meaty asphalt. Potent and powerful, bursting with berries and plums, scented with the aromas of earth and sweet (not dried) herb, chicken stock and flavors that run through the same exotic range. Round and full, forward and balanced, drinking well and maybe just a bit rounder than its brethren.","70",96,"Washington","Cayuse 2008 En Chamberlin Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))","Syrah","2008"
"174925","Red","US","The question concerning this wine isn't whether or not it's very good—it is. Instead, it's about ageability. Made from 100% Cabernet grown in two very different places, Pritchard Hill and Coombsville, it's dry and refined. Floods the mouth with blackberry, blueberry, cassis, dark chocolate, spice and new oak flavors whose richness is tempered by a firm minerality. Really fabulous in all respects, but so delicious now, it makes you wonder why you should even risk more than six years in the cellar.","175",96,"California","Moone-Tsai 2008 Cor Leonis Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2008"
"174926","Red","Australia","A throwback to the monster Shiraz style of old, with loads of toasty, vanilla-laden oak, meaty nuances and driving, intense boysenberry fruit, the 2004 Grange should prove tremendously long-lived.

"174927","Red","US","A tremendous wine that shows how Merryvale is absolutely at the top of its game. Impeccable in structure, with refined tannins that are soft and firm at the same time, and a fine cut of acidity. Entirely dry, the Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend is awesome in blackberry, cherry, cassis and oak flavors, with complexities of anise, soy sauce, grilled meats and minerals. Beyond the particulars, it just feels dramatic and rich in the mouth. A great wine that should develop in the bottle over the next decade.","165",97,"California","Merryvale 2008 Profile Red (Napa Valley)","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2008"
"174928","Red","US","This is the only Cayuse Syrah that is co-fermented (with 8% Viognier), which adds nuances of white flower and floral, though the citrus rind scents override them. In the nose it's hugely expressive, though still quite tight and compact in the mouth; it must be decanted. It's a three ring circus of a wine, with things moving and shaking in all directions. Mineral, berry, mountain complexity, nuanced herb and earth and citrus, all in proportion, and all flowing in the mouth.","70",97,"Washington","Cayuse 2008 Cailloux Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))","Syrah","2008"
"174929","Red","US","Right out of the chute, the garrigue and wild herb flavors are amazing. This is Northern Rhône in a glass, but with New World power behind the fruit. Bright and pungent, a mix of herb and tart berry and rock. Still youthful, and already packed with nuance and flavor.

"174931","Red","US","As good as the winery's other 2008s are, this wine raises the stakes. It's bone dry, deeply tannic and marked by classic varietal flavors of blackberries, cassis and dark chocolate, with sweet, smoky oak. Almost a food group in itself for its complexity, it's dazzling now for its sheer luxurious deliciousness, yet is guaranteed to develop over at least the next 10 years.","125",98,"California","Von Strasser 2008 Reserve Red (Diamond Mountain District)","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2008"
"174932","Red","US","Initially a rather subdued Frog; as if it has been tamed down. Then, suddenly, There's a plush core of blackberry fruit, and the classic Cayuse funkiness is there, drenched in liquid rocks and cured meat and drying tannins.

"176167","White","US","A brilliant Chardonnay. Almost nothing quite like it out there. Great, zesty acidity makes the mouth water, and oak is strongly there but perfectly vindicated by the power of the underlying flavors. They suggest ripe pineapples and tropical fruits, peaches, honeysuckle and a firm, stony minerality that has to come from the soil.

Explosive in grilled meats, blackberries, plum jam, licorice, coffee, chocolate, caramel, black pepper and Chinese 5 spice, yet bone dry, with smooth, rich tannins.

"177809","Red","Italy","Wonderful, this is a wine that will blow you away. It's magnificent on all levels, from its complexity to its long endurance on the palate. Aromas of red fruit, roasted coffee bean, smoked pancetta and soft spice build in intensity and brightness the longer the wine stays in the glass. Firm, velvety tannins promise long aging potential.","65",95,"Piedmont","Aurelio Settimo 2007 Rocche dell'Annunziata  (Barolo)","Nebbiolo","2007"
"177810","White","US","This is easily the richest, densest, most complex of Marimar's 2007 Chardonnays. Made with extended lees contact, it has a fleshy, yeasty freshness that gives the wine extra layers. The grape flavors show typical Green Valley long hangtime notes of exotic tropical fruits, apricots, pears, honey, buttered toast, crème brûlée and sweet baking spices, brightened with acidity. A luxurious, splendid Chardonnay to drink now.","45",95,"California","Marimar Estate 2007 Dobles Lías Don Miguel Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)","Chardonnay","2007"
"177811","Red","Italy","Pio Cesare and the 2007 vintage marry beautifully to produce a layered, opulent, textured, rich wine that is bursting with zesty red fruit, sassy spice, leather and toasted espresso bean.

"177813","Red","US","Another excellent Cabernet from Hestan. It's riper and juicier than the '06, showing the babyfat of this famous vintage. But it's no less complex or ageworthy, just drinkable earlier. Shows concentrated blackberry, black currant, anise, licorice and smoky oak flavors, wrapped into dramatic, thick, firm tannins. Should develop over the next decade and beyond.","100",95,"California","Hestan 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2007"
"177814","Red","US","This is the first wine to be blended each year, though it is not labeled a reserve. The new vintage has amazing depth, running down through a litany of red and black fruits, into veins of earth and tannin and graphite, and finishing with densely textured barrel notes of toast, coffee and bitter chocolate. Beautifully proportioned, deep and cellarworthy.","45",95,"Washington","Mark Ryan 2008 Dead Horse Red (Red Mountain)","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2008"
"178816","Red","US","One of the best Edna Valley Pinot Noirs ever. This region normally produces Pinots with crisp acidity and fine varietal character, and so it is here, with its cherry, black raspberry, red currant and sandalwood flavors. But there's extra depth and complexity, with a wildly exotic, spicy edge, that lift the wine into greatness. Right up there with the best of coastal California.

This one, from the warmer Westside Road area of the valley, is enormously ripe and seductive now, with wild cherry, red licorice, bacon, cola, cocoa and cinnamon spice flavors.

"178821","Red","US","An awesome wine. So delicious and complex now in wild cherry, raspberry, Dr. Pepper cola, bacon and smoky sandalwood flavors, brightened with crisp acidity and totally dry despite the fruitiness.

It's bone dry and rich in stimulating acidity, and the cherry and raspberry fruit flavors have an earthy, mushroomy quality that grounds the wine and gives it a real sense of terroir.

"180115","Red","US","Young and tart in cool-climate acidity, this Pinot needs time in the cellar. It's an exotic wine, spicy and peppery, almost briary, like a Zinfandel, except with flavors of wild forest raspberries, cherries, orange zest and a hint of pine cone.

"180120","Red","US","Here's one for the cellar. It's a big, dry, muscular wine, assertive in tannins, with mineral-driven blackberry and black currant flavors.

Age for 10 years at least.","430",97,"Burgundy","Domaine Leflaive 2008  Bâtard-Montrachet","Chardonnay","2008"
"181042","Red","US","An absolute joy and triumph. Just superb, showcasing the best of Oakville. Perfect tannins, as pure as velvet and sweet, and perfect oak, too, with beautifully applied char and wood spice. That the oak is 100% new is in keeping with the wine's volumetrics. The wine's flavors are a profound, heady expression of blackberries, blueberries, cassis and dark, barely sweetened chocolate. Just spectacular, a real achievement by any world class standard. Production was a scant 275 cases.","125",99,"California","Venge 2008 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2008"

Powerful, yet never pushy, with classic Napa balance. Rich, sweet, almost meaty, with massive tannins that are refined and smooth. Very great density and weight. Really defines the vineyard, and should age effortlessly for 20 years","275",98,"California","Araujo 2007 Eisele Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2007"
"181058","Dessert","US","With this wine, Dolce cements its status as California's most consistently great dessert wine. This year's blend is 80% Sémillon and 20% Sauvignon Blanc, and the grapes were infected with the botrytis, resulting in the fantastic sweetness. Devastating in apricot, orange, pear, honey, vanilla and créme brûlée flavors, in an unctuous, viscous texture, with wonderfully clean acidity, it's certainly one of the greatest sweet California wines in memory.","85",98,"California","Dolce 2006 Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)","Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc","2006"

"181259","Red","US","Sweet new oak stands out, giving this Cabernet caramel aromas and flavors. But the oak is perfectly in keeping with the wine's massive power. Underneath the wood char is a dry, tannic wine with rich blackberry and currant flavors. It's a bit disjointed now, needing time for everything to mesh together. Could be really something around 2015.","125",95,"California","Salvestrin 2007 3D Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2007"
"181444","Red","US","A very elegant and refined Evenstad Reserve, with grace notes of sandalwood and a lovely cherry core.

"182295","Red","US","This is Cabernet Sauvignon lifted to greatness, an impeccable statement concerning this region of the high Mayacamas Mountains on the Sonoma side that, by law, is forced to bear a “valley” appellation. The wine is awesome, vast and complex, fascinating in every aspect, yet locked down in tough tannins that exaggerate the acidity, making the wine functionally undrinkable. It is a beautiful, classic Cabernet, very near perfect, and certainly one of the successes of the vintage.

"184991","Red","US","A spectacular Pinot, continuing a string of great vintages from this little vineyard. The year 2007 gave California supernaturally rich but balanced Pinot Noirs, and this is one of them.

"189650","Red","US","Texture is the name of the game here. We're talking pure velvet, the way the wine glides over the palate with hardly a wrinkle. Beyond the mouthfeel are flavors so complex, they're hard to describe. The blend consists of Cabernet Sauvignon, with contributions from Cab Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, and each grape brings its own distinction, as does 100% new oak. It's approachable now for the softness, and should glide through the next 6–8 years with ease. Expensive, yes, and only 344 cases were produced, but it's worth the search.","90",95,"California","Chateau St. Jean 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2005"
"189651","Sparkling","France","Full, creamy and soft, this is a rich Champagne, very much a food wine. It has great ripe swathes of peach and pineapple flavors, rounded by toast.

"189654","Red","US","This eagerly anticipated Drew Bledsoe/Chris Figgins collaboration is a serious effort, dusty, dense, and dark. To begin are whiffs of cinnamon, smoke, cured meat and bacon; then come tight, dry, stone-soaked flavors of cassis and sweet black fruits.

A dazzling debut.","82",95,"Washington","Doubleback 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))","Cabernet Sauvignon","2007"
"189655","Red","US","This has been one of Etude's best bottlings, and 2007 was a great year. If you enjoy sheer, decadent deliciousness in your Pinot Noirs, this is one for you. The palate first is struck by the rich waves of cherry pie filling, raspberry essence and sweet, vanilla-tinged, smoky oak. Then it discovers the soft silkiness, and finally the firm, fine tannins kick in, providing structure. Just beguiling, and should develop in the bottle over the next 5–6 years.","60",95,"California","Etude 2007 Deer Camp Pinot Noir (Carneros)","Pinot Noir","2007"
"189656","Sparkling","France","As it develops in bottle, this wine retains all its intense acidity. But it has now brought in a toast and yeast character that gives it even greater complexity.

"189658","Red","Italy","Nebbiolo grapes, with their naturally elegant aromas of black currant and licorice, speak loudly.

Dry, smooth and silky, it defines Pinot's more Burgundian side, with mushroomy notes along with perfectly ripe cherries and raspberries, accented with brilliant acidity. The oak treatment is tasteful and blends in seamlessly, offering a hint of toast. The wine treads an exciting line between ripeness and earthiness, while keeping alcohol to a refreshingly low 14.1%. This is a connoisseur's wine.","48",95,"California","Gainey 2008 Limited Selection Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)","Pinot Noir","2008"

The fruit is massive, suggesting black and red sour cherry candy, with oak influences of smoky char and pencil shavings, and complex notes of minerals and sweet violet flowers. But it all needs time to come together. Tasted in a large flight of 2007 Rutherford Cabernets and Bordeaux blends, this was easily the star. Really hard to exaggerate the wine's beauty and elegance.

Concentration on the flavors shows layers of blackberries, black currants, blueberries, mocha, violets, sweet charred oak and a firm grounding of minerals.

Shows fantastically ripe pineapple, golden mango, lemon chiffon pie, buttered toast, crème brûlée and cinnamon spice flavors, brightened with crisp, clean acidity. Almost a food group in itself. Reserve this for your boldest, most upscale fare, like lobster.","65",96,"California","Stonestreet 2008 Upper Barn Chardonnay (Alexander Valley)","Chardonnay","2008"
"191778","Red","US","So pale in color, it's hard to believe it packs so much flavor. Stuns with the complexity of its cherries, raspberries and cola, with fantastically spicy notes. Hard to describe just how intricate it feels, changing by the second as the palate uncovers additional nuances. The vineyard, which is in Green Valley, is coveted among Pinot Noir winemakers. A very great Pinot Noir, defining silkiness and delicacy, and should age effortlessly for at least the next six years.","47",96,"California","Freeman 2008 Keefer Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)","Pinot Noir","2008"
"191779","Red","Spain","A classic wine with maturity but still a lot to give. Aged 24 months in American oak then 12 more months in French barrels, this GR is leathery and powerful, with firm tannins supporting dry berry fruit flavors accented by copious amounts of tobacco, mint, vanilla and more. Will continue to age and soften; drink now through 2025.","119",96,"Northern Spain","Viña Sastre 1999 Pago de Santa Cruz Gran Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)","Tempranillo","1999"
"191781","White","Austria","This is the third vintage of Rudi Pichler's Reserve from the Kollmutz Vineyard. It shows an extra richness over the already concentrated Smaragd, a powerhouse of intensity, spice, mango, oregano and lemon verbena crispness.

"191782","Red","Italy","This stunning wine boasts loads of character that peels off as aromatic layers of cherry, cassis, soapy wild flowers, violets, earth, cola and church incense.

It's tempered, elegant and smooth overall.","80",96,"Tuscany","Altesino 2004 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)","Sangiovese Grosso","2004"
"191783","Red","Spain","Mariano Garcia's deft winemaking touch and propensity for making monster RDDs is etched into this massive, extracted heavyweight, and wow is it good! After a touch of early heat, there's dusty black fruit aromas, spice galore, floral notes and then a huge palate of raw blackness and finally an explosion of creamy mocha, vanilla and woodspice. Needs a couple of more years but not 10 or 20.","55",96,"Northern Spain","Aalto 2006  Ribera del Duero","Tempranillo","2006"
"191784","Red","Spain","A beautiful but enormous style of red wine with char, leather and saturated black fruit aromas. There's also some lemony oak that will shed itself with time. Overall, it's rich, delicious and a real fruit bomb with chocolate, vanilla, caramel, coffee and mocha, all of which are reflections of the oak aging it sees. PS stands for  s seleccionados, and it's really an example of the new school in full session. Best 2013–2017 due to its heft and extraction.","115",97,"Northern Spain","Aalto 2006 PS  (Ribera del Duero)","Tempranillo","2006"
"191785","Red","Spain","From vines that are between 80 and 100 years, this is a marvelous example of top-notch Spanish red wine, regardless of region and grape variety. Hails from four vineyards, and the product is dark, concentrated, sultry, masculine and impressive. Giant black fruit flavors, texture, richness, coffee and cola make it truly special. Drinkable now; best in 3–5 more years.","195",98,"Northern Spain","Viña Sastre 2005 Regina Vides  (Ribera del Duero)","Tempranillo","2005"
"191786","Red","Spain","If there's any such thing as the perfect Spanish red, Pesus is it. A blend of 80% Tempranillo with other grapes including Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine sees 200% new oak, resulting in a thick, dark, tannic beauty that bubbles over with toast, cola, mint, chocolate and spice aromas. The mouth is sheer heaven; a mile deep in terms of berry flavor and more, but faultless and smooth. Shows outstanding structure and power, and should age well for 15–20 years. Hails from two 100-year-old vineyards and some baby vines with but 25 years of age.

"191957","Red","US","Bone dry and utterly balanced, with deeply powerful, long-lasting flavors of blackberries and black currants and an intense, but integrated, coating of smoky oak. But it's also very tannic. Nothing soft about this wine. As fine a cellar candidate as any Mondavi Reserve in years.

"192987","White","US","Made from 100% Sauvignon Blanc, with a great many vines more than 50 years old, this is an enormously complex wine. Fruit doesn't dominate. Flowers and minerals do, with flavors of stones, herbs and earth. What fruit there is brings to mind tart limes and lemons, perhaps white apricots and peaches, with peppery Asian spice accents. Has the weight of a great red wine, and is bone dry. Don't drink it too cold. Will age for a long time, perhaps a decade, in a cool cellar.","75",95,"California","Robert Mondavi 2006 To Kalon Vineyard I Block Fumé Blanc (Oakville)","Fumé Blanc","2006"
"193066","Red","US","There's a beautiful wine in here, but it's buried under tannins. Also, the fruit is all primary blackberry, blueberry, raspberry and cherry jam, while the oak stands to the side, insistent in vanilla and toast. Nothing has merged, everything is separated. Yet this is a great wine, easily the greatest Cabernet to emerge from Livermore Valley in memory. Beautiful now, and should develop for a decade.","100",95,"California","Steven Kent 2007 Ghielmetti Vineyard Clone 4 Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2007"
"193067","Red","US","Big and powerful, but nuanced despite its size. It's a dark, extracted wine, filled with wild cherry, raspberry, currant and sandalwood flavors, as well as exotic notes of forest balsam, grilled mushrooms, tamari and dusty Indian spices. Super-complex, it changes with every sip, and should change interestingly over the next six years. The vineyard is in the Petaluma Gap, and argues strongly for that region's future.","52",95,"California","Fulcrum 2008 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)","Pinot Noir","2008"
"193068","White","US","About as rich and flamboyant as California Chardonnay gets, a wine that blows you away with sheer pyrotechnic wizardry.

"193069","White","US","Amazingly rich and ripe, defining the Bien Nacido cool-climate style. The grapes hung for a long time in this excellent vintage, getting ripe and balanced, and the wine offers dazzling opulence, while preserving vital acidity.

Simply beautiful from first sniff to the last swallow.","30",95,"California","Au Bon Climat 2007 Santa Barbara Historic Vineyards Collection Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)","Chardonnay","2007"
"193070","White","US","A best-of-barrels selection from the winery's various vineyards, this is a lush, intricate Chardonnay made in the modern style. It's fantastically rich in pineapple tart flavors, with the sweet, smoky crust, and more acidic citrus notes of Meyer lemons and limes. Oak aging and lees add fortunate layers of buttered toast and cream. Very intricate, with Chablisian dryness and minerality. Now–2014.","55",95,"California","Testarossa 2008 Diana's Chardonnay (Central Coast)","Chardonnay","2008"
"193071","Sparkling","US","A brilliant brut, comprised of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.

Beautiful now, and should age for many years.","70",95,"California","Schramsberg 2005 Brut Sparkling (Sonoma Coast)","Sparkling Blend","2005"
"193072","Red","US","This is a revelation. The complex and site-specific aromas suggest wild herb, lavender, lemon verbena and black olive. The tannins are supple and ripe, with no green edge at all.

"193073","White","US","Expensive, but brilliant. At the forefront of California Sauvignon Blanc.

Delicious and compelling, this wine lifts Sauvignon Blanc into entirely new territory.","40",95,"California","Chalk Hill 2008 Musque Sauvignon Blanc (Chalk Hill)","Sauvignon Blanc","2008"
"193074","Red","US","A tremendous Cabernet, pure and refined, and undoubtedly the beneficiary of its great vintage. It's dry and elegant, with the slightly herbal tinge and soft tannins that Alexander Valley invariably lends. Yet the flavor profile is dominated by delicious, oak-inspired blackberries, cherries and currants. Brilliant and beautiful, and should develop for many years.","70",95,"California","Goldschmidt 2007 Vyborny Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2007"
"193075","Red","US","A beautiful, classy Cab, marked by smoky new oak and very ripe blackberry and cassis flavors, with a streak of minerals. The vineyard is in the Vaca Mountains, in the valley's far east. You can taste the sunshine in the wonderful fruitiness, and the tannins are extraordinarily refined, but they're also aggressive. Fine now, with a long decant, but should develop bottle complexity over many years.","100",95,"California","Janzen 2007 Cloudy's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2007"
"193076","Red","US","Hard mountain tannins characterize this Cab, which was grown above 2,000 feet in the Mayacamas. It's hugely deep in blackberries and black currants, with notes of dark chocolate and violets. Meanwhile, 100% new French oak adds an elaborate layer of smoky caramel and char that's entirely in keeping with the wine's volume. Impressive and flashy, but immature, this wine requires cellaring.

"193077","Red","US","Hard to exaggerate the beauty of this mountain-grown wine, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon but contains the other four classic Bordeaux varieties. Although it's very tannic, those tannins are remarkably soft. Nearly all-new oak provides a framework of smoky caramel, delicious enough, but just an accompaniment to the blackberries, black currants, cherries and dark chocolate. A fantastic wine for drinking now, and should last for many years in the cellar.","75",96,"California","Legacy 2006 Red (Alexander Valley)","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2006"
"193078","Red","US","This feels slightly softer in the mouth than the massive 2006, but carries the density and gravitas that one associates with Quilceda Creek. Wonderful balance, with a deeply detailed set of flavors that gather strength as they move through the palate. Mixed berries, threaded with chocolate, lingering with black cherry, cassis, smoke, cedar, lead pencil and more.","125",96,"Washington","Quilceda Creek 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))","Cabernet Sauvignon","2007"
"193079","Red","US","This important Pinot Noir is expensive, but it is absolutely worth a search. It's not a single-vineyard wine, but a blend of various blocks from the cooler southern part of the valley. Oak, to the tune of 70% new, is very strong in char and vanilla, but way stronger is the fruit itself, which is exemplary and stunning. Raspberries, cherries and strawberries just begin to describe it, with all sorts of spice and earth complexities. Stuns with purity, complexity and sheer delicious power. Great now, and will easily develop over the next 6–8 years.","100",97,"California","Lynmar 2007 Five Sisters Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)","Pinot Noir","2007"
"194131","Red","US","In this new vintage of Sorella, Cabernet Sauvignon is again right out front at 72% of the blend.

It definitely needs decanting.","64",96,"Washington","Andrew Will 2007 Sorella Red Wine Red (Red Mountain)","Red Blend","2007"
"194136","Red","US","The 76% Cabernet Sauvignon is melded with 17% Merlot, 4% Carmenère, and 3% Malbec, creating a stunningly dense, polished, tight wine. It's light years away from the Leonetti's of the 1980s—compact and loaded with black fruits, pepper, fresh herbs, rock, earth, toast and smoke. It's so tight that it's almost impossible to dissect. It needs time—a lot of time.","85",97,"Washington","Leonetti Cellar 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))","Cabernet Sauvignon","2007"
"194139","Red","US","Superb fruit highlights this tight, sculpted Syrah. It's extremely dense, with deep and intense raspberry and cassis fruit flavor, augmented with coffee grounds, smoke and iron filings.

But already displaying amazing power.","20",96,"Washington","Rulo 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))","Syrah","2007"
"194144","Red","US","A completely different blend from the winery's 2006 Ciel, this reflects Chris Camarda's growing enchantment with Cabernet Franc, which is now 45% of the blend. Most of the rest is Merlot—a Right Bank style. The concept works. It captures the sleek minerality of the site, and puts the fruit into tight, laser-like focus.

"194147","White","US","Bob Cabral's Chardonnays sometimes get lost in the brilliant glare of his Pinot Noirs, but he has spent years exploring the rich, flamboyant side of the variety, with great success. This bottling represents William Selyem Chardonnay at its best. It's ultra-decadent in apricot and pear flavors, with a strong oak influence, and yet an underlying minerality and fine acidity balance it so that it doesn't tire as you drink. In fact, you want more.","50",96,"California","Williams Selyem 2008 Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)","Chardonnay","2008"
"194148","White","US","Huge, rich, white Burgundy style Chardonnay. Has a pie-filling fruity richness of pineapples, lemondrop, pears, kiwi fruit and exotic kumquats, balanced with fine, minerally acidity, and wrapped into a buttercream texture.

"194156","Red","US","This is 100% varietal, from the Loess, Seven Hills, Pepper Bridge, and Mill Creek Upland vineyards. A deep, intense take on Merlot, it's so dark and concentrated that it dances on the )edge of bitterness, but in a style reminiscent of the finest Italian Merlots, that use that flavor to define and elucidate a dark and potent wine. In the mouth it fills out with luscious cherry and plum and blackberry fruit, baking chocolate, coconut and nougat. Yet it remains sleek and stylish, with a strong licorice note.","70",96,"Washington","Leonetti Cellar 2008 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA))","Merlot","2008"
"194158","Red","US","This Père de Famille is 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, with the rest split between Merlot and Petit Verdot.

"194160","Red","US","Awesome Cabernet from this esteemed vineyard in Oakville. Defines the modern Napa style in the perfectly ripe black currant and blackberry fruit, and the ultra-refined tannins. Hard to exaggerate the depth and length, the sheer opulence of this 100% Cab. It was aged in 80% new French oak, which adds even richer notes of wood smoke and sweet vanilla.

"194604","White","US","Massively fruity and oaky, this is an atom bomb of a Chardonnay. You either love this style or you hate it. The pineapple tart, apricot, pear, peach, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice flavors go on and on. Beyond the utter richness is firm acidity and a bracing minerality.

The palate is saturated, pure, tannic and loaded with blasting berry fruit, licorice and more. Let it age for at least another year or two (maybe more). Then let it rip with a porterhouse steak.","120",95,"Mendoza Province","Bodega Catena Zapata 2006 Argentino Malbec (Mendoza)","Malbec","2006"

"195739","Red","Argentina","Probably the best value in high-end Malbec from Argentina is Trapiche's single-vineyard series, which in 2006 was led by this bottling from an Uco Valley vineyard. It's lush, perfectly ripe and full of cola, black fruit and intensity. There's nary a chink in its fiber, and the rush of fruit that hits the palate followed by layers of subtleties is impressive.

"195740","Red","US","This is De Loach's finest Zinfandel of their five new releases. In fact, it's their best Zinfandel ever, and one that defines Sonoma County cool-climate Zinfandel. It's brilliant in balance and structure, with beautifully sculpted tannins and fine acidity, and just the right touch of oak. Within that package are savory flavors of wild blackberries, picked at their peak under the summer sun. So easy to drink, yet so complex.","30",95,"California","De Loach 2007 O.F.S.

"195742","White","France","Straddling richness and beautiful liveliness, this is going to be an impressive wine. It does need aging. At this stage, the wood is a big element, but then the bright white fruits—pears, white currants along with tangerines—will move center stage.

"195743","Red","US","As rich as Napa Cab gets. Made solidly in the modern style, it's soft, elaborate and flamboyant, suggesting ultraripe blackberry pie, currant, mocha-choca and sweet oak flavors.

"195744","White","US","What a roll Fess Parker Winery is on with their '08 Chardonnays. Not only great wine, but priced so well. This wine, sourced from Parker's U Block in this famous Santa Maria Valley vineyard, is as rich as any Chardonnay of the vintage—just massive in pineapple, pear and buttered toast flavors.

"195746","White","France","From a parcel within the Chevalier-Montrachet vineyard, this is beautifully balanced, but a wine with considerable potential.

"195747","Red","US","This is an extraordinarily rich and rewarding Cabernet to drink now. Drenched in all new French oak, it's elaborate in spicy, charred wood and vanillins, but the underlying wine easily supports that weight. It's flamboyant in blackberries, cherries, chocolate, red licorice and cola.

"195748","White","Italy","Made with Malvasia Toscano and Trebbiano grapes (unlike the slightly more complex Occhio di Pernice Vin Santo, which is made from Sangiovese), this is a delightfully rich and concentrated sweet wine that boasts unreal levels of intensity and personality.

"195750","Red","US","Feels fancy and important in the mouth, with pure, refined tannins housing ripe, complex flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherries, chocolate, exotic spices and sweet, smoky oak. The finish is dry but with a tinge of sweetness, like an infused blackberry liqueur, which probably is the result of high (15.3%) alcohol. Very rich and layered, and a great addition to the Napa cult pantheon.

Made from 100% Cabernet grapes, it shows firm, plush flavors of blackberries and black currants, with a sour cherry candy tartness that's clean and piquant in the mouth. But the wine is also very tannic, giving a dry astringency through the finish. Should reward time in the cellar.

"196536","Red","US","Drier and earthier than many Napa Cabs these days, this wine has subtle sage and sweet licorice that grounds its fruitier flavors of blackberries, cherries and raspberries. Very beautiful are the tannins, which are rich and pure, suggesting perfect ripeness. The small Bosché bottling has been a premier one for the winery for many years, and this '05 is one of the best in memory.

"196537","Red","US","A very fine Cab from the estate, which is in the north-central part of the Rutherford appellation. Judging from the tannins, it's too youthful to drink now, with a tight, astringent mouthfeel and fleshy, unintegrated oak. But the flavors are extraordinary. They flood the mouth with the essence of Cabernet, with ripe blackberries, black currants, raspberries and mocha, and the spicy finish lasts for a full minute.

With tangy acidity and ultrarefined tannins, it gives the essence of wild raspberries and cherries.

"197818","Red","US","An impressive Zinfandel, notable for its complexity and charm. Exudes quintessential Zin character, with a mouthburst of red currants, black raspberry pie filling, wild cherries, sweet charred oak and masses of freshly crushed black pepper.

Yields are extraordinarily low, as they are in these coastal ancient vineyards. The wine's concentration is impressive, spanning ripe, crushed raspberries through cherry pie filling to black currants, with all sorts of earthy, minerally, balsam and cedar complexities, not to mention the masses of spice.

"197820","Red","US","This is one of the few California Syrahs that demands time in the cellar. Its tough tannins form an aloof astringency that makes it virtually undrinkable now, but it has an incredible core of blackberry, black currant and dark chocolate fruit. Peppery, anise, leather and spice notes, in addition to slightly caramelized vanillins from 100% new oak, impart great complexity.

"198792","White","US","This is a blend of 92% Sauvignon Blanc and 8% Sémillon. It was partially barrel-fermented and then aged on the lees. It is a very great example of its genre, one of the best in memory.

The entire production of 108 cases was aged in new oak, so there's a lavish veneer of sweet, smoky buttered toast. Sur lie aging is evident in the creaminess and ever so slight sourdough tartness that adds a piquant touch.

"199675","Red","US","A fabulously rich and approachable Pinot Noir that offers everything now, yet will also age. The considerable tannins will protect it in the cellar for a good 6–8 years, but it's so fresh and vibrant in cherries, red currants and oak-inspired red licorice that it's hard not to drink it now. Hard to exaggerate the deliciousness factor.","50",95,"California","Sea Smoke 2007 Southing Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)","Pinot Noir","2007"
"199676","Red","US","A spectacular Pinot Noir, but you don't want to open it anytime soon. Shows the pedigree of this vineyard, a superbly balanced wine rich in acidity and minerals. The fruit? Black and red cherries, blackberries, cola, cocoa powder and red currants, enriched with smoky cedarwood. Beautiful, but needs time.

"199678","Red","US","A real success story for this hot vintage. Feels gracious and generous in the mouth, offering complex, fat flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, mocha and cedar that turn spicy on the finish. The tannins are elaborately ripe and fine. The well-known vineyard is on the Rutherford bench, and production was 2,300 cases. Drinkable now, and should age well for at least a decade.","70",95,"California","Freemark Abbey 2004 Sycamore Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2004"

It's a black-colored, saturated wine that detonates on the palate, offering a blast of black and red berries, currants, cassis, dark unsweetened chocolate, anise and fine, upscale new oak.

Specifically, he knows how to combine power, which is easy, with finesse, which isn't. This 2007, from an esteemed vineyard, is spectacular in wild forest cherry, cola, licorice, pine cone, anise, exotic spice and sandalwood flavors, even as it's perfectly balanced with crisp acidity, fine tannins and just-right oak.

It's utterly distinct from other Pinots in its almost feral complexity, a wine that changes with every sniff and sip. Should develop through 2014.

The acidity is mouthwatering.","34",96,"California","Boekenoogen 2007 Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)","Chardonnay","2007"

"199690","Red","US","This very dense, tannic Pinot Noir represents a triumph for both the winery, the vintage and the region it represents. A multi-clone blend (hence the name) with high, cool-climate acidity and aged in 100% new oak, it's still young, fresh and tight. The astringency throws a cloak over the raspberries, cherries, rosehip tea and Indian spice flavors, which reveal themselves only reluctantly. But they're there, in an imposing texture of velvet and silk. This enormous wine demands time. The window seems to be 2012–2015.","80",97,"California","Sea Smoke 2007 Ten Pinot Noir (Sta.

"199693","Red","US","The 2006 flagship Cabernet from Quilceda Creek is a massive wine that has just begun to emerge from its slumber. When first released the wine seemed to have entered a dumb phase, but six months later it responds to decanting and shows its muscle. Fruit flavors of black, brandied cherries, cassis and bourbon-soaked plums are wrapped in generous, layered oak. The wine is dusty, smoky, laced with streaks of licorice and brightened with sharp acids. It continues to expand further in the glass, adding flesh and spice to its frame, with a cedar/cigar box finish.","125",98,"Washington","Quilceda Creek 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))","Cabernet Sauvignon","2006"

Starts with a very fine nose of cedar, cassis, ripe blackberries and violets, then turns dramatic and refined in the mouth. Shows vast depth and length, with the finish a full minute of sweet fruits and spices. Marvelous tannins, so plush and elegant, so powerful yet refined. The grapes hail from Mt. Veeder, Howell Mountain, Stags Leap and Oakville, and the blend contains 14% Merlot. As good as it is now, it will improve for at least eight years.","200",100,"California","Cardinale 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2006"

With 17.5% residual sugar, this indeed hits the limit of the sweetness scale.

Shows great fruity ripeness in the cherry, Dr. Pepper cola, licorice and bacon flavors, and also a wild, forest quality of grilled mushrooms, thyme and fennel.

A truly great Pinot Noir from a great vintage that needs time in the bottle to express itself.

There's a honeyed richness to the finish, which balances high acidity, making it feel dry. A tremendous brut that should develop for years to come. Now–2020, in a cool cellar.

Yet the flavor explosion is so powerful, you can enjoy it now with utter satisfaction. Erupts in grilled blackberry and cherry, Dr. Pepper cola, bacon, anise, sautéed wild mushroom and smoky sandalwood flavors, leading to a spicy finish that continues for a full minute. Glorious and decadent. The winemaker was Sashi Moorman, from Stolpman, and the vineyard was planted in 1994 to the Calera clone. Only 115 cases were produced.

"201578","Red","US","Acidic and tight now, a young wine that's clearly not ready for current drinking. It needs time to knit together and mellow. But such is the balance of all the parts that it should easily negotiate through at least 2015, when the cherries, berries, cola, bacon, earth, exotic spices and sweet oak should meld.

There are even suggestions of dark chocolate, cassis and minerals as well as sweetness, although it's absolutely dry. It has the most beautiful tannin-acid balance that launches it into classic territory.

"215740","Dessert","France","Right now this is still shy on the nose. There is a glint of pear peel and Mirabelle, plus a suggestion of smoke. The palate is equally shy as the principal sensation is that of wonderfully tangy texture, fresh concentrated acidity and balanced sweetness right now. This needs time to develop its undoubtedly rich flavors. The balance is impeccable. Immense power and lasting strength lie at the core of this monumental wine. This is made to last and should be given time in the cellar.

"215741","Red","US","The fascinating nose of this wine is reason enough to seek it out—an aromatic display of underripe raspberry, tart pomegranate, fresh dill, eucalyptus and sage.

A unique, refreshing and memorable wine.","52",96,"California","Roark Wine Co. 2014 Sanford &amp; Benedict Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)","Pinot Noir","2014"
"215742","White","France","A touch of lemon balm adds a breezy freshness to the nose, while a pure, bright and precise notion of ripe lemon pervades and takes over the entire palate. On its fringes, delicious hints of chamomile and chervil appear alongside ripe red apple. This is a tantalizing charmer in spite of its absolute dryness and vivid acidity.

"215743","Sparkling","France","The producer held this wine back from release because it came from such a great ageworthy vintage—this is well worth the weight. With the wonderful richness of the 75% Pinot Noir dominating, this is a balanced wine, just hinting at toastiness, with concentrated ripe apple fruits melding into the texture of the wine.","160",96,"Champagne","Mailly Grand Cru 2008 Les Echansons  (Champagne)","Champagne Blend","2008"
"215744","Sparkling","France","Interestingly released after the softer 2009 version of this wine, this 2008 vintage is beautifully balanced between crisp fruit and ripe maturity. With its red fruits still in place, it also has a toasty yeasty edge that is sophisticated and enticing. It is a superb wine, delicious to drink now although because of the quality of the vintage it will age for many more years, certainly into the 2020s.","600",96,"Champagne","Louis Roederer 2008 Cristal Brut Rosé  (Champagne)","Champagne Blend","2008"
"215745","White","France","Tender pure peach and fine spicy notions of grapefruit zest unite to create a very inviting nose. The leafiness of fragrant citrus foliage adds extra charm. All these notions continue to play on the very zesty, thoroughly aromatic palate. Citrus flesh and peel shimmers and swirls across mind and palate, creating a dreamy, heightened cloud of fragrant freshness. The palate is just off dry and lip-smackingly bright and fresh. A triumphantly long finish adds the allure of blood orange to this seductive, aromatic wine and makes it utterly irresistible.

"215746","White","France","Whiffs of red-cheeked mirabelle plum, tart red apple, a touch of earth and vivid tangerine immediately signal pleasure. The absolutely straightlaced, concentrated and dry palate adds hints of quince and blood orange. This is dry, even lean but absolutely powerful with bundled flavor. You can feel heat and energy at the core of this, there is real ripeness and force here, played against absolute, vivid and cleansing freshness. High drama indeed. Let it age a while before playing it out. It will be worth the wait. Drink 2022–2037.","65",96,"Alsace","René Muré 2015 Zinnkoepfle Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)","Riesling","2015"
"215747","White","France","A touch of flinty reduction still hangs over the nose, subduing the varietal aromas. But this is only a sign of youth, as is the residual carbon dioxide on the palate. While very young, this holds all it needs for a promising future: A bright core of juicy fruit—think tangerine, tart red apple and ripe yellow pear—as well as the vividly clean and racy freshness of bright lemon. This is concentrated and rather powerful, rapier-like in its cleansing, dry finish but also generous on its fruity midpalate. This is confident and self-assured and stands tall with its powerful structure and body. Leave this to calm down and become itself.

"215749","White","France","An earthy touch of freshly turned soil clings to the pure apple note on the nose. On the absolutely dry palate, however, a beautifully lithe, serene but all-encompassing cloud of lemon freshness just steals the show. It pervades and informs nose, palate and mind. Its luminosity and vivacious freshness just soars and sings. Yes, this is uncompromising. You have to like freshness, acidity and unflinching honesty to be a fan of this, but if you are, this is a ticket to vinous heaven. Wow. This is a real experience and a celebration of site and variety. Hoard this if you can. Gorgeous and fresh now, but far too young.

"215750","White","France","Smoke, orange, wet stone and earth notes are powerful and beguiling on the nose. The palate has absolute concentration and energy and more of that smoky promise. This is like the bundled focus of a laser light—incisive, precise and piercing. Notions of peach, lemon and tangerine dance and hover, but the central core and force remains a kind of drive that could move mountains. This is a sleeping giant, absolute and pure, brooding, laying in wait to unleash its might. The palate is absolutely dry, absolutely fresh, absolutely uncompromising. The finish is piercingly clean.

"215751","White","France","The heady aromatic scent of fresh tangerine peel takes turns with the refreshing perfume of green Seville oranges. The palate takes these enticing aromas and bundles them into one arrow-like force of concentrated freshness. This is a high-wire act of piercing brightness and layered citrus aroma. This is like a self-generating well of freshness that convinces with its luminosity, raciness and rapier-like purity of citrus flavors. Everything is heightened: Fruit, dryness, freshness and vibrant verve. It is tempting but it would be a shame to drink this now. Keep this genie in its bottle for a while longer, if only to see what fascinating direction it takes. This is wondrous.

"215752","White","France","There is something incredibly fruity and simultaneously tart on the nose: It is reminiscent of honeyed deaf nettle blossom as well as passion fruit. Wet stone and lemon heighten these perceptions even more. The palate comes in with concentrated zestiness—there almost is a sobering edge of bitter pith that pulls us towards the earth while the soaring lemon and grapefruit notes lift towards the light. This is fruitful promise and airy spirit, earthy depth and boundless richness. All this comes as a bundled force of joy, freshness and utter pleasure. That beguiling, lemony wet stone appears again on the dry intense finish of this elixir-like wine which perhaps has not only captured the light of the sun but that of the stars, too.

"215753","Sparkling","France","This latest incarnation of the famous brand is a superb wine. It is on par with, maybe even better than, the already legendary 2002. Its balance is impeccable: Apple and citrus flavors working with the tight minerality to give a textured yet fruity wine. Produced from Roederer's own vineyards which are mainly biodynamic, the wine has its own intense purity and crispness. It has amazing potential and is likely to age for many years.

On the palate, the vivid brightness of lemon brightens notes of tart apple and the merest touch of earth and stone. This is precise and pure, absolutely dry and magnificent.

"216016","White","France","A very shy closed nose gives little away but the palate reveals all. A beautifully lithe and fluid synthesis of ripe and tart orchard fruits is leavened by bright citrus, green pear, Cox's apple and pure ripe Amalfi lemon. There also is a fine hint of discreet herbal lift—chamomile and chervil can be glimpsed here and there. What an aromatic, statuesque beauty.

Exquisite tartness tingles deliciously on the tongue and ripples its vivid rays of shimmering bright light across the senses—what a picture of 2014. If you like it emollient and rounded this is not for you. This is for lovers of bright uncompromising purity and freshness. This has real verve, bags of it, all backed up with serious lemon fruit.

Interestingly, the official alcohol is nearly 1% lower at no loss of ripeness, a testimony to the success of the vintage. Offers everything you want in a fine coastal Pinot: crisp acidity, a dry, silky mouthfeel, refined tannins, complexity and ageability.

It stuns with the richness of black cherries and red currants that have an edge of cocoa and pepper, yet finishes totally dry, with balancing acidity. Best of all is the authoritative mouthfeel.

An elegant nose of honey, apricot, butterscotch and spice is followed by a luxuriant, mouth-coating wave of satiny honey and apricot flavors, balanced by citrusy acidity.

It calls to mind the amazing 2001, with its huge, perfect tannins and acids and artistic appliqué of new oak. But the star of the show surely is the fruit. Mounds of ripe blackberries and cherries pile up, veering into currants and cassis and something wild and decadently animal, like charred meat. Fabulous now despite the firm tannins, and should evolve for many years.","225",97,"California","Joseph Phelps 2005 Backus Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2005"

Shows the most beautiful black currant, cedar, blueberry pie and Asian spice flavors. What makes the structure so gorgeous are the firm tannins. Ultimately, it's a refined, exquisite red wine.

The nose is beautiful: coffee, cola, schist, black fruit and herbs rise up. In the mouth, there's strength but restraint; huge black fruit, pulsing tannins and subtleties.

In the mouth, it's rich, creamy-textured and lush, offering the flavors of plum pudding without the excessive weight that the words suggest, plus hints of grilled meat. Again, with airing, it gets even better, piling on more red fruit notes and turning more elegant. A great example of Shiraz, but how many people will be able to justify the $25/ounce expenditure?","625",95,"South Australia","Henschke 2004 Hill of Grace Shiraz (Eden Valley)","Shiraz","2004"

It's opaque as midnight without a moon, and the nose is a delectable blend of vanilla, spice, hickory, mocha and meaty blackberry.

But underneath all that is an explosion of currant, plum, licorice, chocolate and spicy curry flavor that dazzles. Should easily age for a long time in a proper cellar. Production was a paltry 325 cases, and worth the search.","75",95,"California","Girard 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2005"
"230019","Red","US","Classic structured, firm and soft at the same time, with a lyrical, creamy mouthfeel. The tannins are evident now, but that is characteristic of a young Georges, and the reason it ages so well. The depth of blackberries, cherries and currants is unreal and persistent.

The '05 is amazing, a densely structured, deeply flavored Bordeaux blend that's mainly Cabernet Sauvignon. Shows classic notes of cassis, currants and black cherry liqueur, while 70% new oak adds enticingly rich layers of sweet toast and smoky vanilla. The tannins are pure, classic Napa, very refined and ripe, offering solid structural support with no trace of astringency.

The tannins bite and dog the mouth through the long, astringent finish.

"231707","Red","US","This is the grandest of Melville's current trio of '06s. It's also the most ageworthy. Fifty percent stem inclusion in the fermentation has given the wine a tannic, gritty earthiness and spiciness that throw a cloak over the underlying wine.

It's the structure, and not just the ripe flavors, that's so impeccable, giving the wine its backbone and strength. But speaking of flavors, the wine is gigantic in black currants and blackberries. One hundred percent new French oak is completely in accord with the size.

It shows massive flavors of red currants, cherry pie filling, cola, figs and spices that taste like they were baked into a dessert pastry, except that the finish is thoroughly dry. What's hard to communicate is the wine's dazzling structure.

The mixed berries, red licorice, cherries, layers of butterscotch, toffee and caramel are beautifully integrated and linger seductively into the finish. It has some initial alcoholic heat, but the flavors compensate and go on and on. This is a wine that must be cellared another five or more years before it even begins to pull itself together. If you must pop the cork before then, decant it for at least six hours and more if possible before drinking.","115",96,"Washington","Quilceda Creek 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))","Cabernet Sauvignon","2005"

"235859","Red","US","The fragrance is almost otherworldly; sweet, dense and lightly lifted. This is a sinewy wine, that begins with compact power and focused, tart red fruits—predominantly raspberry and currant.

"236490","White","US","Hat Trick is the best of the best of Morgan's estate vineyard, which is in the chilliest northwestern part of the Highlands. Acidity stars, giving the wine a brilliant crispness that's so clean and fine. Barrel fermented in one-third new French oak, the wine is incredibly rich and leesy. The terroir has coaxed out complex layers of pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes, apricots and very exotic tropical fruits suggesting golden mangoes and papayas. The oak adds even richer layers of crème brûlée to this vastly enjoyable wine.","65",95,"California","Morgan 2006 Double L Vineyard Hat Trick Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)","Chardonnay","2006"

Picolit is an indigenous grape that suffers from a unique disorder in which a good number of berries on each cluster never mature. The remaining berries become concentrated in rich flavor and sugar. Livio Felluga's version is a masterpiece that ends with a fresh, menthol-driven finish and a crisp close.

The Meritage labeling identifies it as their supreme bottling of a Bordeaux-style wine. Easily the best Symmetry ever, it is a great wine. Dry and somewhat astringent in tannins, it has an impressively deep core of blackberries and currants, with an array of sweet herbs, chocolate and tobacco.

What is so masterful about the wine is its complex structure. The tannins are fine as can be, offering just the right quality of briskness, and balanced with vital acidity.

Flavors reminiscent of an ice cream sundae work the palate, which means berry syrup, chocolate sauce and vanilla are highly prominent. Texturally speaking, this is a smooth, soft and plush wine.

Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc highlight the beauty of Tuscany and portray the region in terms of thick chocolate fudge, succulent cherry and currant, exotic spice and vanilla seed.

The flavors of red and black currants, milk chocolate, figs and smoky vanilla erupt in the mouth, making the tastebuds jump with joy. However, there is also the structure, among the greatest in California Cabs. The acidity is fine, but the tannins are stupendously rich, sweet and complex, practically a food group in themselves.

It floods the mouth with profound currant, cherry pie, licorice, cola, raspberry, cocoa and vanilla smoke flavors, yet feels light and silky, and is thoroughly dry. That's the magic of Pinot Noir.

In its youth this ‘05 is flashy in lemondrop, pear and spicy anise, with a honeyed finish and crisp acidity. It's quite addictively brilliant, a wine whose lush harmony mesmerizes the palate. But Hanzell Chards invariably age well, and this is a wine you can dependably put into your cellar for 5, 10, 15 years, even longer, as it continues to evolve and become more limpid and minerally.","65",96,"California","Hanzell 2005 Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley)","Chardonnay","2005"

Admittedly, there are significant tannins. But the wine delivers a broadside of the sweetest, ripest cassis fruit imaginable, along with richly toasted oak.

"240776","Red","US","Even in its extreme youth, this lovely Pinot shows a supple elegance that's almost drinkable now. Almost, but not quite. The tannins are ripe and smooth but thick, and the young raspberry, cherry and tangerine fruit needs time to develop and mesh with the oak.

Dry and complex, the wine has cherry, cassis, raspberry and new oak flavors, with good acidity. That extra something is a feral, earthy quality, suggesting olive tapenade, sweet leather, tobacco and mushrooms that has got to come from terroir.

As good as the “regular” Resonance is, this ramps it up another notch or two. The fruit ranges from cherry to prune; the acids are perfect, the barrel notes so well-concealed that you cannot separate them out.

That shyness extended to the taste, where strong, hard tannins provide an almost impenetrable coat of armor to what's inside. But right down the middle of the palate is a deep, intensely powerful stream of perfectly ripened cassis that's all the proof you need of ageability.

The play of flavors, mixing red and purple fruits, toasted nuts, mocha, caramel, bark and earth, is exceptional. The detail is extraordinary for a wine with such high alcohol. The acids and tannins are seamless and fine, and the flavors extend into an unusual finish that suggests menthol and eucalyptus – not generally a character found in Champoux fruit.

Fairly tannic now, with a refined sandpapery grittiness coating pure flavors of ripe cherries, plums and blackberries and their associated liqueurs. The finish is so long, balanced and harmonious.

The texture is velvety-silky and gently tannic, while the flavors are complex, suggesting red cherries with the astringent skins, mashed black raspberries, tangerines, cola, root beer, dark unsweetened chocolate, a touch of cassis liqueur, and something earthy, like Portobello mushrooms.

In fact, the earthiness stands it in good contrast to Napa Valley, making it wholesome and complete.","65",97,"California","Lancaster 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2004"
"242340","Red","US","The '04 Maiden is very close to Harlan Estate in quality. The Maiden is a touch less elegant; but it is such a wholesome wine, so succulent in blackberry, cassis, licorice, and roasted cedar.

It pours dark and saturated, and the tannins are big and sturdy, not aggressive, but sweet and finely ground. Still, they give a hardness to the immaculately ripe fruit that mandates cellaring. The flavors of currants, blackberries, plums, chocolate and cedar are lush, deep and long-lasting, but just a part of the balanced appeal of this young wine.

It brings new levels of richness and complexity to a variety that can be simple even in the best of hands.

The acids and tannins are seamless and fine, and the flavors extend into an unusual finish that suggests menthol and eucalyptus —not generally a character found in Champoux fruit.

It's a profound wine with a gorgeous, entrancing structure that is barely beginning its evolution. Flavors emerge in surprising succession, like spring wildflowers that pop up overnight.

And the palate follows through, delivering waves of fabulously rich fruit that miraculously don't seem heavy. A marvel.","145",95,"Rhône Valley","Marc Sorrel 2005 Les Rocoules Marsanne (Hermitage)","Marsanne","2005"
"245744","White","France","From 50-year-old vines, this is Sorrel's top cuvée of white Hermitage, laden with scents of truffled honey and almonds. Yet despite that obvious richness on the nose, it's a bit more restrained on the palate than the 2005, with a more powerful structure and marginally less lushness. Not better, not worse, just different: longer on the finish, more tightly constructed and probably longer-lived.","140",95,"Rhône Valley","Marc Sorrel 2004 Les Rocoules Marsanne (Hermitage)","Marsanne","2004"
"245745","Red","Spain","What a superb combination of new oak, leather, mineral, mocha and berry fruit this wine delivers. It's a giant, with a ripped palate of upfront boysenberry and then coffee and vanilla in support. All the power, precision and other attributes of modern Rioja are on display. Best in a few more years.","145",95,"Northern Spain","Sierra Cantabria 2004 Finca El Bosque  (Rioja)","Tempranillo","2004"
"245746","White","France","For white Hermitage, this is tight and minerally, with more structure than Chapoutier's other microcuvées and possibly more aging potential. There's a bit of truffle on the nose, but it's not so exotic as the De L'Orée, nor so rich and fat as Le Méal. Finishes with tremendous length and minerality.","260",95,"Rhône Valley","M. Chapoutier 2004 L'Ermite Marsanne (Hermitage)","Marsanne","2004"
"245747","Red","Spain","The bouquet explodes with tobacco, leather, dry oak and waves of berry fruit. In the mouth, the wine sits comfortably on the tongue, with firm tannins offering structure to the bedazzling boysenberry, black cherry and cassis flavors. Long and intoxicating on the finish. It's 90% Tempranillo and 10% Garnacha and Graciano. 650 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.","105",95,"Northern Spain","Finca Allende 2004 Calvario  (Rioja)","Tempranillo","2004"
"245748","Red","France","Le Méal is said to be the warmest terroir on the Hermitage hill, and thus it is no surprise that this bottling fared the best in the challenging 2004 vintage. Flamboyant, creamy waves of raspberry fruit flood the palate, bringing hints of meat, smoke and pepper along for the ride and developing lovely soft tannins on the caressing finish. Approachable now, but should age well through 2020.","202",96,"Rhône Valley","M. Chapoutier 2004 Le Méal  (Hermitage)","Syrah","2004"
"245749","White","France","Chapoutier's top white in 2004 is this knockout cuvée parcellaire he calls De L'Orée. Aromas of truffles and honey burst from the glass, while the flavors lean toward peaches and toasted nuts. It's full-bodied and undoubtedly high in alcohol, but there's no trace of heat, and while it's broad and mouthfilling because of its size, it still finishes fresh and minerally.","160",96,"Rhône Valley","M. Chapoutier 2004 De L'Orée Marsanne (Hermitage)","Marsanne","2004"
"245750","Red","France","How can a wine be this hugely concentrated, yet remain supremely elegant? Espresso, black olive and floral notes zoom from the glass, backed by layers of rich, creamy cherry fruit, making this a complex, complete wine. Tannins are amazingly supple, imparting a velvety feel to the long finish. Drink now–2025 and beyond.","450",96,"Rhône Valley","E. Guigal 2003 La Mouline  (Côte Rôtie)","Syrah","2003"
"245751","Red","Spain","Dark as night, and dominated by meaty plum and beef jerky aromas. The palate is huge, with pure fruit, tannin and chocolate pooling at the finish. A new classic in every sense, with stellar balance and complexity. Less than 400 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.","150",96,"Northern Spain","Sierra Cantabria 2005 Finca El Bosque  (Rioja)","Tempranillo","2005"
"245752","White","France","Chave's white Hermitage is even better than his acclaimed red in 2004. It's wonderfully toasty upfront, backed by layer upon layer of honeyed fruit that simply defies description. Yet despite the incredible richness, there's also tremendous focus and minerality, so that the wine never seems overly weighty, and it finishes with great length and intensity. Drink it now, or try it in 15 years; the 1991 is singing now at age 16.","98",96,"Rhône Valley","J.L. Chave 2004 Marsanne (Hermitage)","Marsanne","2004"
"245753","Red","France","Sure, this wine shows the effects of the hot summer in its slightly jammy raspberry flavors, but there's also incredible complexity to complement the fruit intensity—Asian spices, tea, pepper and meat, to name just a few nuances. It's all wrapped in a blanket of soft tannins, but stays fresh-tasting thanks to great minerality despite low acidity. Drink now–2030 or beyond.","96",97,"Rhône Valley","Domaine Jamet 2003  Côte Rôtie","Syrah","2003"
"245754","Red","Spain","The best new release in the Eguren family's collection of modern Rioja wines is this small-production, 100% Tempranillo. It's a true nuevo classico with proper touches of smoked meat, herbs and sweet black fruits as well as a lush, round mouthfeel that culminates in a mile-long finish. Destined to rock your socks off. Just over 300 cases produced. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.","150",97,"Northern Spain","Viñedos de Paganos 2005 La Nieta  (Rioja)","Tempranillo","2005"
"245755","Red","France","This is breathtaking stuff, incredibly complex on the nose, where it features hints of vanilla, clove, cinnamon, cassis, pepper and asphalt. It would be a wine to sit and smell all day if it weren't so delicious to taste. Rich waves of cassis fruit cascade over the palate without losing complexity, buffered by incredibly supple tannins. The virtually endless finish confirms the quality. Drink now–2030+.","450",98,"Rhône Valley","E. Guigal 2003 La Turque  (Côte Rôtie)","Syrah","2003"
"245756","Red","France","Dense and rich but also incredibly complex, long and elegant, this is a momumental Côte-Rôtie. It's darkly fruited and superripe, yet doesn't lose its essential sense of terroir, remaining marked by scents of pepper and espresso to go with the chocolate and cassis fruit. Velvety in texture, this is the one of Guigal's 2003 Côte-Rôties that demands a few years of cellaring. Drink 2010–2040.","450",99,"Rhône Valley","E. Guigal 2003 La Landonne  (Côte Rôtie)","Syrah","2003"
"246426","Red","US","Beautiful wine, lush and soft in the style of this warm vintage. It's immediately enjoyable for the wealth of cherries, blackberries and raspberries, with a decadent edge of melted milk chocolate. Oak adds extra dimensions of smoky vanilla, caramel, butterscotch and gingerbread. Those who think they don't like red wine will enjoy. Hard to tell if it has the stuffing for the long haul, but it's gorgeous now and for the next six years.","136",97,"California","Caymus 2004 Special Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)","Cabernet Sauvignon","2004"
"246617","Red","US","This is a best-barrels blend whose proceeds go charity. The '05 is a blend of Silver Pines, Van der Kamp, Chris Lee and others, and it's gorgeous. Rewards for its high acid, silky feel, so light and airy, and for the intensity of cola, cherry, pomegranate, smoky vanilla cream and Asian spice flavors that last on the finish. Should pick up additional nuance for the next four years.","54",95,"California","Tandem 2005 Auction Block Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)","Pinot Noir","2005"
"246618","Red","Spain",". Stand up and take note: this is great wine from Priorat. And that's regardless of whether it is typically Priorato in style. It trades textbook minerality for lushness, and the fruit is star quality. In the mouth, there's an explosion of grape matter that leaves coffee, chocolate, peanut brittle and vanilla. Almost drinkable right now but best from 2009.","85",96,"Catalonia","Vall Llach 2004 Red (Priorat)","Red Blend","2004"
"246981","Red","US","I love this wine. The vineyard is in one of the coolest parts of Carneros, where the maritime influence has given crisp acidity boosting long hangtime fruit. The cherry, raspberry and cola flavors are gorgeous, while the earthier pomegranates and rhubarb are elevated to pie-filling sweetness. Yet the wine is entirely dry. What a beauty.","42",95,"California","MacRostie 2004 Wildcat Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)","Pinot Noir","2004"
"246982","Red","US","From the first Pinot block on the estate (1968), and from an unknown clone sourced from a long-forgotten Napa vineyard. The block is now being replanted. This is the Pinot that established Rochioli's reputation, and the bottling remains a superstar. The '05 is very dry, crisp and full-bodied, with a flood of cherry-pie filling, pomegranate, rhubarb, Beefsteak tomato and flashy new oak. It's young and immature in tannins, and needs cellaring. Best after 2009, it will gain complexity through 2015.","90",95,"California","Rochioli 2005 East Block Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)","Pinot Noir","2005"
"246983","Red","US","Three Corner contains some of the oldest vines on the estate, dating to 1974. Typically, the wines start out almost heavy and dense, but age well. Dry, crisp and jammy now, it has a flood of cherry kirsch, raspberry purée, cola and new oak flavors that finish with great charm and complexity. The '05, from a cool vintage, should hold and improve through 2015.","68",95,"California","Rochioli 2005 Three Corner Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)","Pinot Noir","2005"
"247852","Red","US","This is a tremendous Cabernet-based wine. A mixture of Atlas Peak, Howell Mountain, Mount Veeder and St. Helena bench grapes, it's a masterpiece of blending. Seductive now for its lush, soft and brilliant cherry, cassis and mocha flavors that are finished with the smoky vanilla and toast of 96% new French oak, the wine is decadently good.","95",95,"California","Kendall-Jackson 2002 Stature Red Wine Red (Napa Valley)","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","2002"
"247864","Dessert","US","The warm vintage rewarded this dessert wine, yielding incredibly ripe fruit. Barrel-fermented, this blend of Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc was picked at 35% of sugar, and has a residual sweetness of 12.1 grams. The wine is tremendous in apricot jam, pineapple tart, vanilla custard and crème brûlée flavors, with gorgeously balancing, clean acids and a rich, honeyed finish.","40",97,"California","Beringer 2003 Nightingale Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)","Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc","2003"
